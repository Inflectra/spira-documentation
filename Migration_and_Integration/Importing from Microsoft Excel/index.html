<h1 id="importing-from-microsoft-excel">Importing from Microsoft Excel</h1>
<p>The web-based interface of SpiraTeam® is ideal for creating and managing
requirements, test cases and incidents for a new project. However when
migrating requirements, test cases, test steps and incidents for an
existing project from another system or Microsoft Office document (e.g.
Excel), it is useful to be able to load in a batch of artifacts, rather
than having to manually enter them one at a time.</p>
<p>To simplify this task, SpiraTeam® comes with a Microsoft Excel Add-In
that can export requirements, test cases, test steps and incidents from
a populated Excel sheet into SpiraTeam®. In addition, the Add-In allows
you to import those same artifacts back into the Excel sheet to make
batch updates which can then be used to update the master copies on the
server.</p>
<p>Note that this guide refers to SpiraTeam®, but the Excel Add-In can be
used with SpiraTest® and SpiraPlan® as well. The only difference is that
some of the artifact types may not be available in SpiraPlan/Test.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-microsoft-excel-add-in">Installing the Microsoft Excel Add-In</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to go to the "Add-Ons and Downloads"
page of the Inflectra Website (it can be found in the SpiraTest,
SpiraPlan or SpiraTeam sections), and download the <strong>MS-Office Add-Ins</strong>
installation package. There are separate packages for the following
versions of MS Office:</p>
<p><strong>MS-Office 2003 Add-Ins</strong> -- these are compatible with Microsoft Office
2003 and 2007. They can connect to SpiraTeam v2.3 or later. They also
require Microsoft .NET 3.5.</p>
<p><strong>MS-Office 2007 Add-Ins</strong> -- these are compatible with Microsoft Office
2007 and 2010. They can connect to SpiraTeam v3.0 or later. They also
require Microsoft .NET 4.0.</p>
<p><strong>MS-Office 2010 Add-Ins</strong> -- these are compatible with Microsoft Office
2010 and later. They can connect to SpiraTeam v5.0 or later. They also
require Microsoft .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>This installation package will install the add-ins for Microsoft Excel,
Word and Project at the same time. If you don't have the correct version
of Microsoft .NET installed or some of the necessary prerequisites, you
will be given the opportunity to install them when you first run the
installation package.</p>
<p>Once you have the Excel Add-In installed, the second thing you'll need
to download is the <strong>SpiraImportTemplate</strong> Excel Sheet. This spreadsheet
contains the necessary pre-formatted columns that are needed for the
Add-In to easily recognize the data and know how to handle it. There are
<em>three</em> versions of the template available -
<strong>SpiraImportTemplate.xls</strong> for the Excel 2003 Add-In,
<strong>SpiraImportTemplate.xlsx</strong> for the Excel 2007 Add-In and
<strong>SpiraImportTemplate2010.xslx</strong> for the Excel 2010
Add-In.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the template, please double-click on it to open
it up in MS-Excel. You will notice that there is an additional toolbar
displayed in Excel which is used for importing/exporting data to/from
SpiraTeam:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_5.png" /></p>
<p>If you are using the MS-Excel 2007 or 2010 Add-In, you will see a
modified version of the toolbar that makes use of the MS-Office Ribbon:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_6.png" /></p>
<p>This toolbar allows you to connect to SpiraTeam, and perform the
import/export. The process for using this toolbar is described below:</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-spirateam">Connecting to SpiraTeam®</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to click on the [Connect] button to
specify the information used to connect to your instance of SpiraTeam:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_7.png" /></p>
<p>Please enter the following information into the dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Spira URL:</strong> Please enter the web address that you use to access
SpiraTeam® in your browser. This is usually of the form
http://&lt;hostname>/SpiraTeam. Make sure that you
remove any suffixes from the address (e.g. Default.aspx).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Name:</strong> Please enter the username that you use for logging in
to SpiraTeam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password:</strong> Please enter the password that you use for logging in
to SpiraTeam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remember Password:</strong> If you are using this Add-In on a private
computer, you can check this option to have the system remember your
credentials locally. Please do not use this option on a public
computer and it will compromise the security of your SpiraTeam
installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have entered the necessary information, please click
[Connect] to authenticate with the server. If the login information is
invalid, you will see an error message appear, otherwise you will be
connected and the list of projects and artifacts will be populated. If
you want to end your session, you should just click the [Disconnect]
button and the Add-In will close your connection.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-project-and-artifact">Choosing the Project and Artifact</h2>
<p>Once you have successfully connected to SpiraTeam, you should now choose
the appropriate Project and Artifact in the system that you will be
importing / exporting:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_8.png" /></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_9.png" /></p>
<p>The artifact choice will match the name of the Excel sheet in the
template, so if you are going to be importing/exporting Requirements,
you should choose "Requirements" from the dropdown list and then click
on the "Requirements" tab inside the Excel import template.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the project and artifact, there are three buttons
that you can now use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Import:</strong> Clicking this button will retrieve the data from the
SpiraTeam server and use that to populate the spreadsheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export:</strong> Clicking this button will take the data in the
spreadsheet and use it to add/update items in SpiraTeam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear:</strong> This button allows you to quickly clear the data in the
import template while leaving all the necessary headings and other
information that the Add-In needs to be able to import/export data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> (Only in MS-Excel 2007/2010 Add-Inx). This button
allows you to change some of the import/export options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="importing-exporting-data">Importing / Exporting Data</h2>
<p>The Excel Add-In is capable of either importing data from SpiraTeam into
the Excel template or exporting data from the Excel template to
SpiraTeam. However it is important to understand how the system knows
whether to add new items to SpiraTeam or whether to update existing
items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you start with a blank import spreadsheet and enter items into
it, they will not have a value set on their ID column in the
spreadsheet (this is always the first column in each sheet). When
you perform an Export, it will add these as new items in SpiraTeam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you start with a blank import spreadsheet and choose to Import
data from SpiraTeam, those rows will include the ID of the item in
the first column of the spreadsheet. You can either update those
rows or add new rows in between. Any rows that have the ID column
populated will be <em>updated</em> in SpiraTeam when you choose Export,
whereas any newly added rows will be <em>inserted</em> in SpiraTeam.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importingexporting-releases">Importing/Exporting Releases</h3>
<p>To import/export releases, first you need to click on the "Releases" tab
in the Excel sheet:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_10.png" /></p>
<p>Next if you want to import the list of existing Releases from SpiraTeam,
you should click on the [Clear] icon to first remove the sample
information from the spreadsheet, then click [Import] to load the list
of existing releases into the sheet. These items will all have the "Rel
#" column populated so that the system knows to update them rather than
insert them when you subsequently click [Export].</p>
<p>If you want to simply export a list of releases from a spreadsheet, then
you need to either enter the releases into this specially formatted
spreadsheet or cut and paste them in from another existing Excel sheet
that you've been using to manage releases previously. Then click
[Export] and the new items will be added to your instance of
SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>The various columns that can be imported, and the rules for entering
data are listed below:</p>

<p>Note: the columns that are required are listed in <strong>bold</strong> type.</p>
<h3 id="execute-test-cases-offline">Execute Test Cases Offline</h3>
<p>As well as being able to import/export data, you can also use the import
spreadsheet to execute test cases while disconnected from your network
and then upload the results to SpiraTeam as a single batch.</p>
<p>To do this, when connected to the network, connect to the server using
the Add-In [Connect] icon, select the project and "Test Runs", then
click on the "Test Runs" in the spreadsheet:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_16.png" /></p>
<p>Now you should click on the [Import] button, and the Add-In will load
the list of Test Cases (and in the case of the MS-Office 2007/2010
Add-Ins, any Test Sets as well) that are currently assigned to you
together with open cells (marked in green) that you can use to record
the actual results of testing:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_17.png" /></p>
<p>You can now disconnect from the network and perform the testing
activities offline. Enter the following entries into the spreadsheet:</p>
<p>Status          The execution status of that test step. It should be selected drop the dropdown list. The allowed values are: Failed / Passed / Blocked / Caution.
Actual Result   The long description of the actual result experienced during testing. If you want it formatted, you need to add HTML tags such as &lt;b> for bold
Incident Name   If you want to log an incident associated with the test failure, enter the name of the incident here. The description of the incident will be pre-populated with the Test Step Description, Expected Result, and Actual Result.</p>
<p>Once you have finished testing and are connected back on the network,
just click on the [Connect] icon to have the Add-In connect with the
SpiraTeam server, choose the project name and "Test Runs" and then click
[Export]. The test results will now be uploaded to the server.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you are using the MS-Excel 2007/2010 Add-Ins, you will also
see the Test Set ID, Release ID and TX TC ID (Test-Set, Test Case unique
ID). You can manually set a Release ID on test cases that were not part
of a test set.</em></p>
<h3 id="importing-custom-property-list-values">Importing Custom Property List Values</h3>
<p>To import/export custom property values (for list custom properties),
first you need to click on the "Custom Values" tab in the Excel sheet:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_18.png" /></p>
<p>Next if you want to import the list of existing custom list values from
SpiraTeam, you should click on the [Clear] icon to first remove the
sample information from the spreadsheet, then click [Import] to load
the list of existing custom list values into the sheet. These items will
all have the "Value #" column populated so that the system knows to
update them rather than insert them when you subsequently click
[Export].</p>
<p>If you want to simply export a list of custom list values from a
spreadsheet, then you need to either enter the custom list ID and value
name into this specially formatted spreadsheet or cut and paste them in
from another existing Excel sheet that you've been using to manage the
values previously. Then click [Export] and the new items will be added
to your instance of SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>The various columns that can be imported, and the rules for entering
data are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Field name</strong>          <strong>Description</strong>
Value #                Stores the ID of the custom list value. Should be left blank for new items being added to SpiraTeam
<strong>Custom List #</strong>      The ID of the custom list that the value is being added to (with the CL prefix removed). For example custom list CL00005 would be entered as just "5"
<strong>Custom Value Name</strong>   The name of the custom value that you are inserting/updating in SpiraTeam</p>
<p>Note: the columns that are required are listed in <strong>bold</strong> type.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-importexport-options">Changing the Import/Export Options</h2>
<p>In the MS-Excel 2007 and 2010 Add-Ins, you can change how the
import/export works by clicking on the Options icon. This brings up the
Options dialog box:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Importing_from_Microsoft_Excel_19.png" /></p>
<h3 id="rich-text-setting">Rich Text Setting</h3>
<p>When you import artifacts from SpiraTeam into MS-Excel, if they have a
formatted description, by default all the HTML tags that are used to
describe the formatting will be loaded into the Excel cell. This is
useful if you plan on making changes and then updating SpiraTeam (since
it will preserve the formatting).</p>
<p>However if you want to be able to more easily read the descriptions in
Excel and do not plan on updating SpiraTeam, you can select the option
to Remove the Formatting, which will convert the descriptions to
plain-text before loading them into Excel.</p>
<h3 id="test-run-date-setting">Test Run Date Setting</h3>
<p>If you set a date for the 'Test Run Date', the importer will use that
date to be the date the test runs were executed on, rather than the
current date/time, which is used by default.</p></div>
