Too often though, QA is implemented as Quality Control - whereby testing that the required functionality works as expected, is performed at the end, when it is most costly to make corrections and changes.</p> <p>To manage QA across a product from day one, it is imperative that the original requirements are documented together with the use-cases that validate the desired functionality. These use-cases then form the basis of the test scripts that can be executed to validate that the functionality has been correctly built, and that the requirements have been satisfied. During the execution of these test scripts, failures may occur, which are recorded as incidents - either to be fixed or documented depending on the severity.</p> <p>Typically, these activities require people to use at least three different types of software:</p> <ul> <li>Requirements Management</li> <li>Test Script Management</li> <li>Defect / Issue / Bug Tracking</li> </ul> <p>However, this stove-piped approach has many limitations and drawbacks, most importantly the fact that there is no traceability between the different artifacts. How can the product manager know that all the requirements have been tested? Conversely, how can the developer know which test script was responsible for a recorded bug -- needed to accurately reproduce the issue?</p>"},{"location":"About/introduction-to-spira/#product-management","title":"Product Management","text":"<p>As described in the Agile Manifesto, traditional waterfall software methodologies and lifecycles have failed to deliver products on-time and on-budget. In addition, many systems built this way will fail to provide the expected business value as there is no ability to quickly refine the requirements as the product progresses.</p> <p>Consequently, software development has been transformed with these new ideas and concepts, with new agile methodologies such as Scrum, and Kanban becoming common. However, the traditional tools of product management - requirements specifications, high level product plans, GANTT charts, white-board schedules and top-down task management - are too cumbersome and not well suited.</p>"},{"location":"About/legal-notices/","title":"Legal Notices","text":"<p>This publication is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p> <p>This publication could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.

This let's you see the health of your CI/CD process within Spira. You can record the results of a build against a single release, or multiple releases, even if they are in different products. Any CodeBuild project that is set up to report to Spira will also report to Spira if the project is run as part of an AWS CodePipeline.

Devs in Jira create and manage requirements/user stories, so these sync one-way to Spira. Spira users can see incidents created in Jira, but bugs reported by QA can be see in Jira. After bug creation, Jira users are in charge of updates, which sync back to Spira.</li> <li>The bidirectional sync mode is similar to default, except that incident fully sync both ways - for new incidents/issues, and their updates. </li> <li>The NoRequirements sync mode is for when Spira is used to create new incidents and tasks, but Jira is used as the system where incidents and tasks are updated. </li> <li>The NoIncidents sync mode is for when you want to mainly sync requirements (or tasks) between Spira and Jira, but not incidents. In the other modes, incidents are the default artifact that syncs, but this mode sets requirements to be the default artifact. This means all the Jira Issue types will sync against Requirements or Tasks (if Task Types are configured).  </li> <li>Users are not synced - instead Jira users are mapped to existing Spira users, wherever possible. </li> <li>Comments are always synced from Spira and to Spira.</li> <li>Attachments are created in the other system when new artifacts/issues are created. Attachments are not created or changed during updates</li> <li>If you are syncing requirements, the hierarchy is not synced due to the fundamental differences in how this functions in Jira and Spira</li> <li>If you have two separated Jira instances to sync from/to, please follow these instructions to set up a second DataSync plugin without data duplication</li> </ul>"},{"location":"External-Bug-Tracking-Integration/Using-SpiraTeam-with-JIRA-5%2B/#checklist","title":"Checklist","text":"<p>For the data sync to work correctly make sure you meet all of the steps below:</p> <ul> <li> Use Spira v6.3.0.1+</li> <li> Use Jira Server or DataCenter 5+</li> <li> Setup a datasync  service on your own servers</li> <li> Configure the plugin in Spira</li> <li> Configure system wide user mapping</li> <li> Download the Jira configuration helper application</li> </ul> <p>Then, for each product you want to sync:</p> <ul> <li> Activate the datasync</li> <li> Configure release mappings</li> <li> Configure standard field data mappings</li> <li> Configure custom field data mappings</li> </ul>"},{"location":"External-Bug-Tracking-Integration/Using-SpiraTeam-with-JIRA-5%2B/#configure-the-plugin","title":"Configure the Plugin","text":"<p>Make sure you have setup a datasync service before going further</p> <ul> <li>Login to Spira as a system administrator</li> <li>Go to System Administration &gt; Integrations &gt; Data Synchronization</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Find the plugin called JiraServerDataSync and click the \"Edit\" button to open the settings page</li> </ul> What do if the plugin is not there <p>If you don't see the plug-in in the list, click the \"\"Add\" button at the top of the page.

Put something like \"Jira\" or leave it blank. If you have multiple Jira instances, you will need a separate plugin for each one. Each plugin needs the same name so use the caption field to make it clear each one is different</li> <li>Description: this is an optional field you can use to help describe to your future self the setup and use of the plugin</li> <li>Jira URL: enter the full URL of the Jira instance to connect with (make sure to include any custom port numbers). Entering this URL into a web browser should bring up the Jira login page and is typically of the form: <code>https://mycompany.atlassian.net</code></li> <li>Jira Login: enter a valid login to the Jira instance that has permissions to create and view Jira issues and versions.

Also Jira is on a server set to a different time-zone, you should add in the number of hours difference between the servers time-zones here.</li> <li>Auto-Map Users: This changes the way that the plugin maps users between Spira and Jira.

This can be left empty for now and will be discussed below in Configuring the Data Mapping.</li> <li>Task Types: This should be set to a comma-separated list of IDs of any Jira issue types that you want to be synchronized with Spira tasks instead of incidents.

How each mode works is explained above:</p> <ul> <li>Default (leave blank): recommended for most users.</li> <li>Bidirectional: enter the word \"Bidirectional\" to use this mode. Recommended for advanced users only. Only use this mode if you have a well-defined set of workflows that make sense in both systems, and that do not conflict. If using this mode make the polling interval as short as possible (to avoid conflicting changes in the two systems) as the integration works at the record-level, not the field level.</li> <li>NoRequirements: enter the word \"NoRequirements\" to use this mode</li> <li>NoIncidents: enter the word \"NoIncidents\" to use this mode</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Requirement Types: This should be set to a comma-separated list of IDs of any Jira issue types that you want to be synchronized with Spira requirements instead of incidents. If you leave this blank, all Jira issue types will be synchronized with incidents (user stories/epics will not be synced at all). This field is ignored when using the sync mode \"noIncidents\", as Requirements are the main artifact of this mode.</p> </li> <li>Link Type: This field should either be set to the name of a Jira issue link type or be left blank. If you want the datasync to create links between Jira issues, based off of existing associations between Spira incidents and/or requirements, then enter in an issue link type name. If you do not want Jira to create these links between issues based off data in Spira, then leave this field blank. The artifact associations from Spira will sync to Jira as links of that type.

Devs in Jira create and manage requirements/user stories, so these sync one-way to Spira. Spira users can see incidents created in Jira, but bugs reported by QA can be see in Jira. After bug creation, Jira users are in charge of updates, which sync back to Spira.</li> <li>The bidirectional sync mode is similar to default, except that incident fully sync both ways - for new incidents/issues, and their updates. </li> <li>The NoRequirements sync mode is for when Spira is used to create new incidents and tasks, but Jira is used as the system where incidents and tasks are updated. </li> <li>The NoIncidents sync mode is for when you want to mainly sync requirements (or tasks) between Spira and Jira, but not incidents. In the other modes, incidents are the default artifact that syncs, but this mode sets requirements to be the default artifact. This means all the Jira Issue types will sync against Requirements or Tasks (if Task Types are configured).</li> <li>Users are not synced - instead Jira users are mapped to existing Spira users, wherever possible. </li> <li>Comments are always synced from Spira and to Spira.</li> <li>Attachments are created in the other system when new artifacts/issues are created. Attachments are not created or changed during updates</li> <li>If you are syncing requirements, the hierarchy is not synced due to the fundamental differences in how this functions in Jira and Spira</li> <li>If you have two separated Jira instances to sync from/to, please follow these instructions to set up a second DataSync plugin without data duplication</li> </ul>"},{"location":"External-Bug-Tracking-Integration/Using-SpiraTeam-with-Jira-Cloud/#checklist","title":"Checklist","text":"<p>For the data sync to work correctly make sure you meet all of the steps below:</p> <ul> <li> Use Spira v6.3.0.1+</li> <li> Use Jira Cloud (we have a separate data sync for Jira Server / DataCenter)</li> <li> Setup a datasync  service - either in Inflectra's cloud or on your own servers</li> <li> Download the Jira configuration helper application</li> <li> Configure the plugin in Spira</li> <li> Configure system wide user mapping</li> </ul> <p>Then, for each product you want to sync:</p> <ul> <li> Activate the datasync</li> <li> Configure release mappings</li> <li> Configure standard field data mappings</li> <li> Configure custom field data mappings</li> </ul>"},{"location":"External-Bug-Tracking-Integration/Using-SpiraTeam-with-Jira-Cloud/#configure-the-plugin","title":"Configure the Plugin","text":"<p>Make sure you have setup a datasync service before going further</p> <ul> <li>Login to Spira as a system administrator</li> <li>Go to System Administration &gt; Integrations &gt; Data Synchronization</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Find the plugin called JiraDataSync and click the \"Edit\" button to open the settings page</li> </ul> What do if the plugin is not there <p>If you don't see the plug-in in the list, click the \"\"Add\" button at the top of the page.

Put something like \"Jira\" or leave it blank. If you have multiple Jira instances, you will need a separate plugin for each one. Each plugin needs the same name so use the caption field to make it clear each one is different</li> <li>Description: this is an optional field you can use to help describe to your future self the setup and use of the plugin</li> <li>Jira URL: enter the full URL of the Jira instance to connect with (make sure to include any custom port numbers).

Also Jira is on a server set to a different time-zone, you should add in the number of hours difference between the servers time-zones here.</li> <li>Auto-Map Users: This changes the way that the plugin maps users between Spira and Jira.

Recommended for advanced users only. Only use this mode if you have a well-defined set of workflows that make sense in both systems, and that do not conflict. If using this mode make the polling interval as short as possible (to avoid conflicting changes in the two systems) as the integration works at the record-level, not the field level.</li> <li>NoRequirements: enter the word \"NoRequirements\" to use this mode</li> <li>NoIncidents: enter the word \"NoIncidents\" to use this mode</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Requirement Types: This should be set to a comma-separated list of IDs of any Jira issue types that you want to be synchronized with Spira requirements instead of incidents. If you leave this blank, all Jira issue types will be synchronized with incidents (user stories/epics will not be synced at all). This field is ignored when using the sync mode \"noIncidents\", as Requirements are the main artifact of this mode.</p> </li> <li>Link Type: This field should either be set to the name of a Jira issue link type or be left blank. If you want the datasync to create links between Jira issues, based off of existing associations between Spira incidents and/or requirements, then enter in an issue link type name. If you do not want Jira to create these links between issues based off data in Spira, then leave this field blank. The artifact associations from Spira will sync to Jira as links of that type.

If you cannot see any work items with the mapping information, we recommend sending a copy of the event log message(s) to Inflectra customer services (support@inflectra.com) who will help you troubleshoot the problem.</p> <p>To use SpiraTeam with TFS on an ongoing basis, we recommend the following general processes be followed:</p> <p>When running tests in SpiraTest or SpiraTeam, defects found should be logged through the Test Execution Wizard as normal.</p> <p>Once an incident has been created during the running of the test, it will now be populated across into TFS as a work item of type corresponding to the types setup in the incident type mappings.</p> <p>At this point, the incident can be worked on in either system, with changes being synchronized to the other system. However in general we recommend that the QA/Testing team use SpiraTeam and the development team use TFS. E.g. the developers will mark the bugs as resolved in MSTS once they have completed fixing them and the QA team will either reopen or close then in SpiraTeam once they have had a change to verify the resolution.</p> <p>You are now able to perform test coverage and incident reporting inside SpiraTest/SpiraTeam using the test cases managed by SpiraTest/SpiraTeam and the incidents managed collaboratively between SpiraTest/SpiraTeam and TFS.</p> <p>You can create project requirements and associated tasks in either SpiraTeam or TFS, however the synchronization service is only unidirectional for requirements and tasks, so when you create or update a requirement or task in TFS, the change will be reflected in SpiraTeam, but not the other way around.</p>"},{"location":"External-Bug-Tracking-Integration/Using-SpiraTest-with-MS-TFS/#description-handling","title":"Description Handling","text":"<p>Whereas Spira has a single artifact Description field, ADO/TFS has three possible \"Description\" fields depending on the templates setup by an administrator:</p> <ul> <li><code>Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps</code> (rich text)</li> <li><code>Microsoft.VSTS.Common.DescriptionHtml</code> (rich text)</li> <li><code>System.Description</code> (plain text)</li> </ul> <p>The plugin checks for each of them in the order above.

In order to do this, you need to:</p> <ul> <li>Create two different DataSync plugins.

One workflow step applies to Bug1 and a different workflow step applies to Bug2.</p> <p>So roles let admins control who can see what in general. Workflow let admins control, if you can see something (say a bug), exactly how that bug (for example) should behave based the bug's state at the time. When you change an item's state (by changing this bug's status, for instance) you can change how it will look or behave.</p> <p>How do you change an item's state?

The application shows all of this data in a seamless way to users. Report views will often also combine this information. For example, a task has an assigned owner. The database only saves the ID of the user, but the custom report view for tasks shows both the user's ID and their name.

For example the 'Project Overview' section will include the project name, description and other meta-data and the 'Requirements Summary' section will include an XML representation of all the requirements in the project together with any child data nested (e.g. all of tasks that belong to a requirement or the list of comments, etc.). A key aspect of a standard section is that the data itself is not customizable, but you can change the XML Template (XSLT) that is used to extract the data and convert it into a viewable form. So you have the ability to use XSLT to transform the data. You also allow the user who runs the report to use the standard set of filters on the data (e.g. return only requirements in release 1.0 or test cases that are priority 1,2,3)</li> <li>On the other hand, a\u00a0custom section, lets you use a custom database query using the\u00a0Microsoft Entity SQL (ESQL) language to query the different database view in the system join records, aggregate data to generate a completely custom table of data that you can then transform using an\u00a0XML template\u00a0(XSLT) to display it in a specific form (e.g. a table of\u00a0 data, a simple list, etc.). So you have the ability to use two tools: ESQL and XSLT to generate the report. The advantage over the standard section is that you are not limited to the queries that we have already defined in the system, but a custom section does not provide filter options for the end user.</li> </ul> <p>A report you create can have a mixture of the two sections, for example you could start the report with the standard project name and description and follow that with a custom section that displays a table of custom data (e.g. a risk cube or other table of data).</p>"},{"location":"Reporting/Custom-Report-Tutorial/#how-to-create-and-edit-a-custom-report","title":"How to Create and Edit a Custom Report","text":"<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to:</p> <ol> <li>Clone a built-in standard report</li> <li>Use the \"Standard Section\" XML editor to make some changes to the XSLT template to hide some columns and add a new calculated column.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Reporting/Custom-Report-Tutorial/#clone-a-standard-report","title":"Clone a Standard Report","text":"<p>The first thing we need to do is make a copy of one of the standard reports s that we can change it.

Note: If you do not see the menu as in the screenshot you can get to this same place from the Home ribbon, new query section.</li> <li>This brings up the Navigator window showing all the different tables of data we can access in SpiraPlan</li> <li>Scroll down and click on \"IncidentStatuses\" then click OK</li> <li>This now loads up data from our second query on IncidentStatuses and selects this view</li> </ul> <p>We now have two different queries that are completely independent from each other. We want to connect them together. For each incident we want to get extra information about its status. The main query is Incidents, and the secondary query is IncidentStatuses. So click on the Incidents query in the Queries sidebar to make sure we are viewing our Incident query again. Now, carry out the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Click the \"Merge Queries\" button from the Home ribbon of the query editor</li> <li>This opens the Merge popup</li> <li>At the top it shows our incident query with all its columns</li> <li>Below that is a dropdown - open that to select \"IncidentStatuses\" - so we can merge it with Incidents</li> <li>We now need to match up the data: in the Incidents box click on the \"INCIDENT_STATUS_ID\" column, then in the IncidentStatuses box also click on the \"INCIDENT_STATUS_ID\" column</li> <li>This is telling Excel that INCIDENT_STATUS_ID in Incidents is the unique reference for IncidentStatuses to find matching status rows in</li> <li>Leave the dropdown called \"Join Kind\" as \"Left Outer\"</li> <li>Click OK</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>We now see the output of our merge query. Our query looks very similar - it has the same number of rows, but has gained an extra column \"IncidentStatuses\" at the right. The Applied Steps list has a new entry too: \"Merged Queries.\" We know that merge has worked, but we can't see any extra data yet. That's because Project data is collapsed: in each cell in the IncidentStatuses column we see the word Table, which tells us that there is a whole set of data hiding inside that cell, waiting for us to look at it.</p> <p></p> <p>This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> and final step of the merge - choosing which columns to show from our extra data we have merged in. To the right of the IncidentStatuses column name you will see the little button looks different. It is not a dropdown arrow but a weird double arrow. Click this to choose how to expand the data from the IncidentStatuses data into new columns. You will see the familiar column picker. Only select the IS_OPEN_STATUS field and click OK.</p> <p>The table is updated with an extra column called \"IncidentStatuses.IS_OPEN_STATUS\" and the Applied Steps list has a new entry \"Expanded IncidentStatuses.\"</p> <p></p> <p>In this simple example we have added extra information to each incident row about the incident status that applies to that incident. </p> <p>The same principles can be used for combining data from many other tables together. The critical thing for this to work is that there are columns that match between the two tables you want to join. Imagine, for instance, if we match INCIDENT_ID from Incidents with INCIDENT_STATUS_ID from IncidentStatuses. The data may look interesting but it would be nonsense and not useable. It should almost always be obvious by the column name how it will match up with other columns in different tables.</p> <p>As a final step in this tutorial, let's do something with this extra data we have. We now know which incidents are open or closed but that IS_OPEN_STATUS flag (TRUE = open, FALSE = closed). Filter on the \"IncidentStatuses.IS_OPEN_STATUS\" column the same as any other column, and select only the open incidents (TRUE). This added a new Applied Step \"Filtered Rows1.\"</p> <p></p> <p>This query is really easy to do on the list of Incidents using SpiraPlan itself. We have replicated that functionality using OData to talk between Excel and SpiraPlan. In this way you can easily compare SpiraPlan and your query to see if the results match. As you can see the image above and the one below show the same exact incidents in the same order (because have applied the same filter and sorting in both places).</p> <p></p> <p>In the final tutorial we are going to build on the query we have built but rapidly extend it with a number of other joins and semi-advanced filtering.</p>"},{"location":"Reporting/OData-Tutorial/#building-complex-queries","title":"Building complex queries","text":"<p>In this tutorial we start with the output from the previous tutorial: a list of open bugs and enhancements for one product.

It combines data across 6 different tables from SpiraPlan to show us details about the user assigned to each incident and the program, and portfolio each incident is in. Your data should look something like that below (note the list of Applied Steps). If at anytime you have done something wrong, remember you can edit a step, or delete a step entirely and do it again.</p> <p></p> <p>We're ready for the final stage: grouping data. This will let us count up the number of incidents assigned to each user. Follow the steps below:</p> <ul> <li>Click \"Group By\" from the Home ribbon</li> <li>Click the Advanced radio button in the dialog popup</li> <li>This let's us add the different fields we want to show in our data after the group. Add groupings for: Users.USER_NAME, Users.DEPARTMENT, Portfolios.NAME</li> <li>Leave the rest of the dialog with the defaults and click OK</li> </ul> <p>.</p> <p>This results in a condensed query of data that has unique rows for each user in each portfolio. The right hand column is called Count and is the number of open bugs and enhancements that the user has in that portfolio.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Click \"Close and Load from the ribbon to load this data into Excel. From here you can do anything with the data you want. For instance, you can turn it into a pivot table to tell you how many open bugs and enhancements there are, in total, in each portfolio. </p> <p>This brings us to the end of the OData tutorial series. Hopefully you can see the power of OData and the ease with which you can interrogate your data and draw out insights from it.

In this case, choose \"SQL Server Authentication\" under \"Connection Information\" section and provide SQL Server Login that has full sysadmin permissions -- e.g. the built in System Administrator (SA) account.

There are two main sections to this page -- Data Caching and Indentation Hierarchy:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Database Indexes: In order to improve the performance of SpiraPlan\u00ae, it can be beneficial to refresh the database indexes. Clicking the \"Refresh\" button illustrated above will refresh all relevant database indexes across all SpiraPlan products. If for any reason performance seems to be slower than usual after a large import of data (for instance from Excel, or using the product migration tool) or after a recent database upgrade, you should consider refreshing the indexes. Depending on the size of the database, this could take some time. Please keep the web page open throughout the process to ensure it can complete successfully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Caching: In order to improve the performance of SpiraPlan\u00ae, certain types of product data are cached. Very occassionally, the cache can get behind the data in the actual database. In such cases, refreshing the cache will make sure the cache is fully up to date and correct data is therefore displayed in the application. If users report this kind of problem in one of the cache areas, click the relevant Refresh Cache button.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indentation Hierarchy: The Requirement and Releases pages use an \"Indent\" system for managing the hierarchy of information. This allows requirements and test cases to be nested under parent items and be rapidly searched and filtered on. Sometimes if a move/copy operation is interrupted (due to a network outage, etc.) the hierarchy may get corrupted. If you suspect a problem with either of these artifacts, click the \"Check\" button. Once the check has run, if you see a red Error message instead of the Green OK that means problems were found. If that happens, click the \"Correct\" button and the system will correct the indent levels.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Spira-Administration-Guide/Product-General-Settings/#source-code","title":"Source Code","text":"<p>Clicking on the Source Code link in the administration menu will, if a source code provider has been set up by a system administrator, show a screen like the one below.</p> <p></p> <p>The first thing you need to do (regardless of whether you'll be overriding any of the settings) is to make the provider active for the current product.

By default the system assumes a 5-day (Mon-Fri) working week, but if your organization works Saturdays (for example), you may want to switch to a 6-day working week. If you want to use partial days, then just round up to the nearest day and add non-working hours (see below) to compensate.</li> <li>Non-Working Hours Per Month: this setting allows to specify how many non-working hours typically need to be accounted for. This is useful if you want to have a working week that contains a fractional number of days or if you have recurring activities that need to be removed from each month. Note that if you have specific holidays, vacation days that need to be accounted for, it is better to use the Release/Iteration non-working time feature instead.</li> <li>Effort Calculations: When calculating how much effort has been scheduled in a release or iteration, the system will aggregate the individual effort values (both estimated and actual) for all the task, incident and test cases artifacts associated with the release/iteration. This setting allows you to specify if you want only task, incident, or test case effort values to be included in the release/iteration total.

However if many requirements are typically a standard size, then as a time-saver, the system will let you specify a default estimate value that will be used when a new requirement is created.</li> <li>Point Effort: When requirements are added to the Planning Board or Iteration planning screen, they will have an initial effort (in hours) that is used until tasks are added (see Auto-Create Tasks option). This field contains the standard conversion factor used to convert points into hours based on the current team velocity (how much time it takes on average to accomplish one story point). As the product progresses, the team velocity will change, so you can click on the [Suggest] button to have the system calculate how many hours each existing story point has taken to implement in the product and provide that as a recommendation:</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Auto-Create Tasks: When you change the status of a Requirement in the system to \"In-Progress\" the system will automatically add a default Task to that requirement if no tasks already exist.

Once a requirement is then in 'Planned' status, transitioning to a different status may blank out the release field. This happens when you transition to any of the following statuses (as they are considered to be earlier in the requirement process): 'Requested', 'Accepted', or 'Under Review'. </li> <li>Use Task Status: When this option is enabled, if you add any tasks to a requirement, the status of the requirement will be automatically governed by the aggregate status of the associated tasks. On adding a new task to a new requirement, the requirement will move to \"Planned.\" Once a requirement has reached the \"Planned\" status, if any of its tasks are started and incomplete, the requirement status moves to \"In Progress\". Once all of a requirement's tasks have been completed, its status will move to \"Developed\" or a \"later\" status in the requirement workflow.</li> <li>Use Test Status - When this option is enabled, if you associate any test cases to a requirement, the status of the requirement will be automatically switched from \"Developed\" to \"Tested\" when all the associated test cases are passed.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Spira-Administration-Guide/Product-Planning/#task-incidents","title":"Task &amp; Incidents","text":"<ul> <li>Default Effort: Normally when you create a new Task in the system it will be given an empty initial estimated effort.

There are four different sections to administration, and each has its own permission. These sections and their permissions are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>System Administration: tasks like approving new users, creating new products, changing security settings, or viewing the logs all happen at the system-wide level of administration. There is a special \"System Administrator\" flag that can be assigned to any user (by an existing system admin only). Any user that has this flag can perform any system administrator task. Please note that a special \"administrator\" user is created by the installer. You should initially login to SpiraPlan\u00ae with the username <code>administrator</code>, and the password <code>PleaseChange</code>. Change this password as soon as possible to something that is secure yet memorable by clicking on the \"User Profile\" link.</p> </li> <li> <p>Product Administration: a product admin can make changes specific to that product and that product only. For instance, they can add or remove users from a product. Once a user is made a product admin, they can perform all the actions in the product administration section. Each individual product has a defined set of users who are members of that product. Each member is assigned a specific role (many users can share the same role), and a role can be set to be a product admin. Please note, that when a system admin creates a product, they are automatically added as \"Product Owner\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Program Administration: just like with products, some aspects of a program are managed in the program section of administration. Anyone who is assigned the role of \"Program Owner\" on a program can perform these administrative functions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Template Administration: end users of the application will work with products and sometimes programs. However, behind the scenes of every product is a template. This template controls the bulk of how that product is configured and will work for the end users. Each product is controlled by one template, though each template can control many products at once. Making a change to a template in template administration will immediately affect all products controlled by that template. Such changes to a template include changing the name of incident types, changing the colors used to indicate requirement priorities, or changing custom properties. Please note that template admin permissions are managed by the same roles that manage product admin permissions and that apply to members of each product. You can read more about how template admin permissions work here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Report Administration: a report admin can administer custom reports and graphs (create, edit, delete). They can also access custom report data in 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools via OData and the API. These functions are also available to system admins under System Administration. However report admins can only access the reporting functions and pages - they have no access to any other admin functions. There is a special \"Report Administrator\" flag that can be assigned to any user (by an existing system admin only). Any user that has this flag can perform any report administrator task.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Spira-Administration-Guide/System-Administration/#administration-menu","title":"Administration Menu","text":"<p>Once you have logged in as an administrator, you can click the \"Administration\" link which can be found on the right-hand side of the global navigation at the top of any page:</p> <p></p> <p>This will display the context aware administration menu popup. This menu will show different sections depending on where you are in the application and your administrative privileges. For example, only system administrators see the \"System: Admin Home\" section shown at the bottom of the screenshot below.</p> <p>In the screenshot below you can see that administration links are being shown for three different sections:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Library Information System -- which is a product</p> </li> <li> <p>The template called Sample Template: Agile (this is the template the controls the above product)</p> </li> <li> <p>System wide administration</p> </li> </ol> <p>This menu only shows the links to one product, one template, or one program at a time (and System Admin all the time to system administrators). Because this user is currently viewing a page in the product 'Library Information System', admin items for that product and its template are visible.</p> <p>You can see that the \"Requirements\" sub section is highlighted. This is because the user is currently on a requirements page of the 'Library Information System' product (either in the main application or in template administration). The highlighting serves no function other than to guide the user to where they may wish to focus.</p> <p></p> <p>Below is an example of an administration menu where a user is a Program Owner but with no other access to administration. This menu is much barer than the one above, because the administrative options this user has are that much more limited. This user only has admin access to Sample Program One. If they navigate to a different program page or to a product page in the application, they would not see the admin menu at all.</p> <p></p> <p>If a user wants to see what, if any, parts of the system they have administrative access to, they can do so at any time. Clicking on the workspace dropdown on the global navigation will show them the list of workspaces they have access to. Below, you can see that products are grouped into programs, and there is a dedicated Templates section at the bottom. Any workspace the user has administrative access to has a superscript gray cog to the right of that workspace's name.</p> <p></p> <p>If this user wants to access the admin menu for \"Sample Barebones Product\", first that cog tells them they can do so. By clicking on that workspace's name, they will be switched to that workspace and then they can click on the admin button to get the right menu.</p> <p>In the screenshot above at the top there is a \"System Administration\" workspace. This is visible because this user is a system administrator. Clicking this will take the user directly to the System Administration home page.</p> <p></p> <p>The Administration home page, like all admin pages, is divided into two areas:</p> <ol> <li> <p>the skinny left-hand bar. Clicking this will show the context-aware administration menu discussed above</p> </li> <li> <p>the main pane that displays the available options for the selected page.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This home page shows a number of useful widgets with information about the system. You can edit these widgets, their position, and what is shown, using the two buttons in the top right (the cog and the plus).</p> <p>Product and Template administration home pages also show useful data and links relevant to them. On most admin pages for products and templates the name of the current product or template is shown at the top of the page in a heading. These names are hyperlinks that will open the product or template administration home page.</p> <p>When you first install the system, we suggest three main tasks to perform as the system administrator to get familiar with the basics and to help colleagues start to use the application:</p> <ol> <li>Create a new product</li> <li>Create the users that will be accessing the system</li> <li>Add users as members to a product</li> </ol> <p>These tasks typically need to be performed before any other users can use the system, since there will be no logins or products available other than the sample ones provided during the installation.</p> <p>Below is the admin menu for a user who is a report administrator but has no other active admin roles.

There are also different permission models for accessing the application itself (ie not the administration pages). How do you set each of these permissions so that a user can only see / use what they are supposed to?</p> <ul> <li>We start with a user: without a user, your colleague can not even log in to the application</li> <li>Then add a user to a product: a brand new user cannot do anything or see anything in the application. The most common way of granting a user access to the system is to add them as a member to specific products</li> <li>Give the user the correct role for a product: when you add a user to a product, you have to set the specific product role they should have. This grants them specific permissions to view certain data, edit other data, maybe the ability to delete some data too. Each user has to be actively given a particular role for each product. In other words, you cannot make a user a member of a product without giving them a specific role. Likewise, you cannot make a user a \"Tester\" for any products they are or will be a member of. Multiple users can be assigned the same product role.</li> </ul> <p>Product roles have two special flags. Changing these flags immediately affect anyone with that particular role:</p> <ul> <li>Any product role can grant the user product administrator access. One of the special product role flags is product administrator. Any person with a role that has product administrator set to \"Yes\" can carry out all administrative tasks on that product.</li> <li>Any role that grants product ownership access can also grant template admin access. The second special flag on a product role is that of Template Admin. If a role grants product administrator access it can optionally also grant template admin access.</li> </ul> <p>Permissions for programs are more simple and managed on a per program basis:</p> <ul> <li>Access to view / edit a program: to view a program dashboard or its pages, a user has to have access, with a particular role, to that specific program. Program roles are either Executive or Owner. Program Owners can carry out any administration tasks on the program. NOTE: a user with a program role is given view-only permissions to all products within that program. This view-only access is superseded by any specific product roles they have on the individual products themselves.</li> </ul> <p>Each user profile has two special flags about permissions, which affect the entire system, but only for one user at a time (they are completely separate to product and program permissions):</p> <ul> <li>SpiraPlan Users can be granted portfolio viewer access: The first special flag on the user profile is Portfolio Viewer access. This allows a user access to all portfolio pages and enterprise pages in the application. In other words, you do not control which portfolio a user can see, but only if they can access all portfolios or none of them. Only a system administrator can set this on a user.</li> <li>Users can be granted system administrator status: this is the second special flag on a user profile and makes the user a system administrator. Only a system administrator can set this on a user.</li> </ul> <p>System administrators and product roles</p> <p>Note: if a user is a System Administrator, it will force that user to always have the 'Product Owner' role on all their assigned products, regardless of the chosen role.

On this page you can change the following fields:</p> <ul> <li>Name: Choose the name of the standard report section you want to use from the dropdown list. Changing the name of the section will automatically update the Description field below.</li> <li>Description: This is the description of the report section, it is not displayed in the final report.</li> <li>Header: This is the header that will be displayed before the dynamic data retrieved as part of the report section. You can enter in formatted rich text in this field.</li> <li>Footer: This is the footer that will be displayed after the dynamic data retrieved as part of the report section. You can enter in formatted rich text in this field.</li> <li>Template: This is the eXtensible Markup Language Stylesheet Transform (XSLT) used to transform the raw XML data from the report query into the final HTML display format.

By default, SpiraPlan will use the regional settings (language and number formats) of the operating system it has been installed on. However, you can override this default by choosing the appropriate culture from the list of options displayed in the drop-down list. Note: The list of culture options does not reflect the available language packs, so in some cases, the setting will only change the number formats.</li> <li>Default Timezone: SpiraPlan stores all dates and times internally in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and can therefore display dates/times adjusted for different timezones. By default, SpiraPlan will display dates in the timezone specified in the operating system it has been installed on. However, you can override this default by choosing the appropriate display timezone from the list of options displayed in the drop-down list.</li> <li>Web Server URL: This is the URL that your users use to access the system. Do not put the /Login.aspx or any other page here, as this URL is used to generate links to pages in the application.</li> <li>Attachments Folder: By default when SpiraPlan\u00ae is installed, the document attachments uploaded in the system get stored inside     the <code>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraPlan\\Attachments</code> folder located inside the main SpiraPlan\u00ae installation root.

This can result in higher levels of network traffic and some system administrators may wish to disable this feature. This option lets you disable the integrated instant messenger. In addition, you can specify how long (in days) instant messages are retained in the system.</li> <li>Event Log Retention: As described in  Event Log, SpiraPlan comes with a built-in diagnostic event log. By default the system will only retain the last 30-days of events to avoid wasting storage space. You can adjust the retention period in this section to match your organization's policies.</li> <li>Enable Free Text Indexes: This tells SpiraPlan to use SQL Server Free Text Indexing to speed up keyword searches in the Global Search box.

However, you need to first configure the LDAP server settings. To do this, click on the \"LDAP Configuration\" link the Administration navigation:</p> <p></p> <p>You need to fill out the various configuration settings for your LDAP server, each of which is explained in more detail below:</p> <ul> <li>LDAP Host: This should contain the name of the LDAP server that you want SpiraPlan to connect to together with the port number if it's not the default of 389.</li> <li>Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): You should select this check-box if your LDAP server requires use of the LDAPS secure protocol. Leave unchecked for unencrypted LDAP communication.</li> <li>Base DN: This should be the distinguished name of the object inside your LDAP server that contains the list of user accounts. This varies by the type of LDAP server, please consult your LDAP server documentation for more details.</li> <li>Bind DN: This should be the distinguished name of the user inside your LDAP server that will be used to authenticate against when importing users. If not provided, SpiraPlan\u00ae will try and authenticate with the LDAP server anonymously.</li> <li>Bind Password: The is the password of the user specified in the Bind DN field above.</li> <li>Login Attribute: When SpiraPlan\u00ae imports users from the LDAP server it needs to know the user attribute inside the LDAP server that it should use to generate the SpiraPlan\u00ae user-name. For most LDAP servers the appropriate attribute would be \"uid\". However for Windows ActiveDirectory, the attribute \"sAMAccountName\" should be used instead.</li> <li>First Name Attribute: Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the first name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder.</li> <li>Last Name Attribute: Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the last name field of the imported user instead of simply using the username as a placeholder.</li> <li>Middle Initial Attribute: Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the middle initial field of the imported user instead of simply leaving it blank.</li> <li>Email Address Attribute: Providing this optional attribute will allow SpiraPlan\u00ae to automatically populate the email address field of the imported user instead of simply using the username@spiratest.com as a placeholder.</li> <li>Sample User: You can optionally enter a sample user and password to test that the user is correctly authenticated against the server. You can update the LDAP configuration without setting this, but if you do provide a sample user/password, it will not save the configuration unless the authentication succeeds.

SpiraPlan lets you trace what commits (and therefore file changes) contributed to a bug fix. To do this SpiraPlan reads commit messages for special tokens that it turns into links between the commit and those artifacts. If SpiraPlan finds any links in the commit message it automatically creates the association between the commit and the artifact(s). You can view these associations from the commit details page, or from the associations tab of any artifact.</p> <p>How does this work? The commit message has to contain one or more artifact token. For example [TK:123], or [IN:456], or [RQ:789]. These tokens are short and do not get in the way of the rest of the commit message. Artifact tokens are in the following format: <code>[{artifact identifier}:{artifact id}]</code></p> <p>The first half of the token is a two-letter code, used throughout SpiraPlan and visible on almost every page in the application. For example, a requirement's identifier is \"RQ\". Incidents are \"IN\", and test cases are \"TC\". The artifact ID is the number of the artifact. If you go to the details page for an artifact, you will always see this artifact token near the top of the page. Clicking on it copies it to your clipboard. Then you can paste it into your commit message.</p> <p>Note: If you forget to add the association during the commit, go to the details page for that commit in SpiraPlan, and click 'Add Association' to add the association at any time.</p>"},{"location":"Spira-User-Manual/Commits/#commit-list","title":"Commit List","text":"<p>When you click on Developing &gt; Commits on the global navigation bar, you will be taken to the commits list screen.

This allows you to centrally plan your automated testing and monitor the results of automated unit, functional and load testing remotely. For example, you could schedule a set of automated functional tests to run on five different machines (each with a different browser/OS combination) at 2:00 AM and have the results be ready for the next morning.</p> <p>SpiraPlan\u00ae provides the ability to create, edit, assign, track, manage and close incidents that are raised during the testing of the software system under development. These incidents can be categorized into bugs, enhancements, issues, training items, limitations, change requests, and risks, and each type has its own specific workflow and business rules. Typically each incident is raised initially as a 'New' item of type 'Incident'. Following the review by the product manager and customer, they are changed to one of the other specific types, given a priority (critical, high, medium or low), and status changed to 'Open'. Once it is assigned to a developer for fixing, it is changed to status 'Assigned'.</p> <p>The developer now works to correct the incident, after which time its status changes to 'Fixed' or 'Not Reproducible' depending on the actions taken (or not taken). Finally the product manager and customer verify that it has indeed been fixed, and the status is changed to 'Closed'. SpiraPlan\u00ae provides robust sorting and filtering of all the incidents in the system, as well as the ability to view the incidents associated with particular test cases and test runs, enabling drill-down from the requirements coverage display, right through to the open incidents that are affecting the requirement in question.</p> <p>As described above, in addition to storing the requirements for a product, SpiraPlan\u00ae includes the capability of drilling each lowest-level requirement down further into a series of work items called 'Tasks'. These tasks are the discrete activities that each member of the development team would need to carry out for the requirement to be fulfilled. Each task can be assigned to an individual user as well as associated with a particular release or sprint. The system can then be used by the product manager to track the completion of the different tasks to determine if the product is on schedule.</p> <p>The tasks can be organized into different folders as well as categorized by different types (development, testing, infrastructure, etc.), each of which can have its own workflow which defines the process by which the task changes status during the product lifecycle.</p> <p>SpiraPlan\u00ae includes an integrated document management collaboration system that can be used to upload, manage and share documents between the different members of the product. This module includes support for uploading files and URLs, versioning of documents, the ability to organize into folders and categorize and search using meta-tags.</p> <p>SpiraPlan\u00ae (not available in SpiraTest or SpiraTeam) enables a complete risk management workflow. This module aids in the analyzing and categorizing of risks based on their Probability and their impact, which produces a calculated risk exposure. The tool tracks both risks and their mitigations, and provides dynamic risk reporting tools.</p> <p>SpiraTeam\u00ae and SpiraPlan\u00ae let you browse your source code from within the main web application. This is an excellent way to browse all a product's code files, commits, and how a file changed in a commit (the 'diff'). There is no need to install version control software on your own computer or to clone the source code to your machine. All users can link source code commits with any SpiraPlan\u00ae artifact. This gives you traceability from requirements, incidents, tasks, and more to right code changes. This let you easily see what code was edited to implement a feature, or fix a bug. If the bug is reopened later, you can quickly see the associated source code commits to check if the changes made actually did fix things properly.</p> <p>SpiraPlan\u00ae integrates with a variety of continuous integration / automated build servers so that the results of automated builds can be displayed in SpiraPlan linked to the associated release or sprint. In addition, the results of automated tests and source code operations can be linked to the build events, providing traceability from a specific build to the bugs that were fixed, tests that were run, and source code files that were modified.</p> <p>SpiraPlan\u00ae comes with a build-in integrated instant messaging capability. This lets users see which users are currently logged-into the system, maintain a list of contacts and where available, send short instant messages to other users. Any messages exchanged can then be posted to relevant artifacts in the system as permanent comments.</p>"},{"location":"Spira-User-Manual/Incident-Tracking/","title":"Incident Tracking","text":"<p>This section outlines how the incident/defect tracking features of SpiraPlan\u00ae can be used to manage key product artifacts during the software development lifecycle.

Here are a few to help guide you using them.</p> <ul> <li>You have two separate but similar products - one for an iOS app, the other for an Android app. Create a capability for a common feature (e.g. a new user interaction), and link the relevant requirements to that capability. You can now easily see how those requirements are doing. This lets you know when the higher level capability is ready so you can release the feature to both platforms at the same time. In this way, you can track progress of similar or complimentary features delivered across multiple products.</li> <li>You have multiple products that each create a module for a larger application. You can create capabilities at the program level to represent the features of that large application. By linking a capability to the requirements in the various product that it depends on, you can track how the modules are progressing at that higher level, and capture interdependencies at the program level.</li> <li>You are building a new feature set for a large project that will consist of multiple parts / products. Create capabilities as you plan out the large project. You can create parents and children to better organize them. When you are ready you can go one level lower and create the requirements for each part / product, then link them up</li> <li>You want to track cross-product activity unrelated to specific product requirements. Maybe your products are all separate, but there are still some work you want to capture that spans the whole program. You could create capabilities to capture work for improving documentation across a multi product documentation site, or for marketing work required to better explain new features across all your relevant products.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Spira-User-Manual/Program-Capabilities/#progress","title":"Progress","text":"<p>A capability's Progress is a special field that shows a mini chart.

Once development is complete, the code is ready to merged into the central branch (typically main, or development) ahead of release. Pull requests are a way to flag that the feature branch is ready for merging. A pull request lets the developer(s) of the feature ask colleagues to review the code, assess if changes are needed, and if everything looks good  approve the pull request / merge into the main branch.</p> <p>If your SpiraPlan product is connected to a source code repository, you will be able to use SpiraPlan's pull request functionality. This lets you create a pull request, select the branch you want reviewed, the branch the code will be pulled / merged into, and assign a team member to review the request. The reviewer can explore the code that was changed in the branch add comments or notes to the pull request, and move it through a workflow as needed. The requester can track any changes made to the pull request, so they can, as needed, make additional changes to their code.</p> <p>SpiraPlan's pull request feature leverages the Task artifact. Tasks have different types. You can set any of these tasks types to be treated as a pull request task. Task types are managed via template administration.

You can use this feature to see the state of every test case, requirement, and incident as they were the moment that baseline was created. You can see how an artifact changed between 2 baselines (or between the baseline and when the product was first created if you are looking at the earliest baseline).</p> <p>In SpiraPlan, we attach baselines to a release, as well as to the state of the product changes. This is to help you more easily use baselines as part of your release planning and review: baselines are, in effect, tied to the progress of your releases and sprints. You may wish to create a baseline when your release starts, and then create another when it is released. You may create a baseline at the end of every sprint and then use your baselines to see what happened between those two sprints.</p> <p>Once a product has baselines, product owners can explore each baseline to see what artifacts were added, changed, or deleted in a baseline.</p> <p>Here is a step by step overview on getting started with baselines:</p> <ul> <li>First, enable baselining for your specific product via the edit product page.

This lets a single test case get called multiple times by another test case (as a link) and have different parameters passed in each case, making the operation different. </p> <p>Parameter Example</p> <p>You have a test case \"login to application\". This test case has 2 parameters: username; and password. It has default values for these parameters of \"user\" and \"correct-password\". We set the Sample Data field to read: \"Username = ${username}, and password = ${password}\". You can reuse this test case in other test cases by linking links.</p> <ul> <li>If you execute the \"login to application\" by itself you will see that sample data reads: \"Username = user, and password = correct-password\"</li> <li>Now add this test case as a linked step to another test case \"Can login successfully\". When you do this you get the option to override the defaults. We don't want to do this yet, so we blank out the parameter values in the link test step dialog. When we execute \"Can login successfully\" sample data still reads: \"Username = user, and password = correct-password\". Even though our test case is not setting values for these at all, the linked test step uses its default parameter values.</li> <li>Next, edit the linked test step \"login to application\". We see the two parameters with boxes to type in parameter values. We add a value for \"username\" of \"admin\" (but keep password blank still). Now when we execute \"Can login successfully\" sample data will be different - we are overriding the default parameter values: \"Username = admin, and password = correct-password\"</li> <li>We have not changed the default values - we are passing down values that override the default values for this specific test case and to this specific linked test step. </li> </ul> <p>Hopefully, the above example begins to show you the flexibility of parameters. You can add the same test case as a linked step multiple times and pass down / override different values each time - useful for testing different logins. You can link test cases together in more complex ways - with test cases nested inside each other. </p> <p>With complex test case / link structures, you can still pass down parameter values. Building on the above example, let's add the test case \"Can login successfully\" to a new, third, test case called \"Can login and logout successfully\". We now have 3 test cases in a chain. When we add \"Can login successfully\" as a link we can only edit one of the original parameters: only \"password\". We are not able to edit \"username\". This is because when you override a parameter value in a link once, you cannot override from higher up in the chain. </p> <p>In other words, during execution, parameter values are set by the linked step's defaults if no parent test case overrides them; and by the test case parent closest to the originating linked step that sets an overriding value for a parameter.</p> <p>To view / change the parameters associated with the current test case, click on the \"Edit Parameters\" button in the toolbar to see and edit the list of current parameters for this test case:</p> <p></p> <p>Existing parameters are shown in a list. For each parameter you can: </p> <ul> <li>edit a parameter - you can change the token name, and update/add/remove the default value</li> <li>delete an existing parameter</li> <li> <p>insert the parameter token at the current cursor position. To do this:</p> <ul> <li>edit the relevant test step</li> <li>open the Edit Parameters popup</li> <li>position the cursor where you want it in on one of the test step fields</li> <li>click \"Insert at Cursor\".</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To add a new parameter to the test case, use the form at the bottom of the popup dialog.

In addition, recorded failures of test cases can be used to automatically generate new incidents that will be added to the incident tracking module and, optionally, to tasks.</p> <p>You start test case execution in SpiraPlan by either:</p> <ol> <li>selecting test cases or test sets on their respective page(s) and clicking the \"Execute\" button;</li> <li>clicking the \"Execute\" button on the test cases / test sets listed on your personalized home page under \"My Test Cases\" or \"My Test Sets\".</li> </ol> <p>If you execute a test set then the values of the selected release and custom list properties for the test run are automatically populated from the test set, whereas if you directly execute a test case itself, those values can be chosen by the tester.</p> <p>If you attempt to execute a single test case that you are in the middle of testing (from either a test case, group of test cases, or a test set) a popup will ask if you want to resume one of those existing, not-yet-completed pending test runs, or start a new test run.

You can also specify any test run custom properties that have been defined by the product owner. This ensures that the resulting test runs and incidents are associated with the correct release of the system, and that the test runs are mapped to the appropriate custom properties (e.g. operating system, platform, browser, etc.).</p> <p>If you have not configured any releases for the product, then the release drop-down list will be disabled and the test runs/incidents will not be associated with any particular release.

The progress bar also has a number of navigation buttons to help you move around the test run, or to leave the test execution page. Between the buttons are indicator blocks. For test runs with relatively few test steps, each indicator block represents a single test step. A tall dotted line is used to indicate the end of one test case and the start of another. When there are many test steps to a test run, each indicator block represents a test case. Hovering over an indicator block will display a tooltip with information about the test step or case represented. The color of the indicator block matches the color of any assigned execution status for the test step or test case (see below).</p> <p>The rest of the page contains the \"test execution area\". This has details about all of the steps in the test run. It can be used to both navigate between test cases and test steps, as well as to actions on any test case or test step (for instance assigning an execution status or logging an incident). This area can look markedly different depending on which display mode a user has selected. However, in every mode, a tester will be able to readily view the name and description of the test step (and at times the parent test case), along with the description of the test step, instructions for carrying out it, and any expected results.

Exploratory testing is designed for relatively experienced testers and rather than to record the results of a pre-determined set of steps, to instead adjust and create the testing sequence during the act of testing itself. During exploratory testing test steps can be added, removed, edited, moved freely, at any time.</p> <p>Care must therefore be taken that this form of testing and of recording the results of a test are used appropriately. The conditions set by the system are one means of limiting its use.</p> <p>When starting exploratory testing the main screen will resemble the one below. Note that it looks broadly similar to that for standard test execution and is made up of three different areas:</p> <ol> <li>a list of test steps on the left;</li> <li>details about the currently selected step on the right; and</li> <li>information at the top of the page about the test run itself (it's name and description, release, and how many steps it contains), along with a mini toolbar. In exploratory testing there is no progress bar, or options to layout the page in different views.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>All fields in the right hand details area, or the top part of the page can often be edited. Their contents and associated label will be grayed out if they are read only fields (for instance if they are information from a custom property). To edit a field, click on it, change the text as required, then click out of the field. The information will be automatically saved. Note that any test steps that come from a link test case will be read only and as such their contents cannot be edited, nor can they be deleted.</p> <p>Just like with normal test execution, you can navigate between steps using the list of steps on the left; and steps can be passed, or failed using the execution status toolbar on the right hand section of the page. The unique actions you can take on test steps (besides editing their fields) are below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>add a step: click on the plus button beneath the list of test steps on the left</p> </li> <li> <p>clone an existing step: when you hover a test step in the list, you will see a button appear on its right. Click on this to show a mini menu with an option to clone the step. This will create a clone, at the bottom of the list of test steps, with a blank actual result</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>delete an existing step: if you have more than one test step, any editable test step can be deleted. Click on the button for that step (as explained above) and click delete from the mini menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>move an existing step: to move an editable step click and drag it to the desired location in the test step list.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Below the main detailed section there are two or three tabs. SpiraTest users will only see two tabs -- incidents and attachements. SpiraPlan users may see the additional  tasks tab (if enabled by the product admin). </p> <p>The toolbar at the top right of the page has a number of buttons:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Pause/Play button: the time spent on every test step is recorded, by default, during test execution. This allows an accurate assessment of exactly how long a test run took to complete and these timing details are saved with the test run and its results. If you wish to pause the behind-the-scenes timer (for instance if taking a break) click the pause/play button. To resume the time click it again.</li> <li>Leave button: as with normal test execution, if you are not able complete the exploratory test in a single session, click the \"Leave\" button---shown with an eject symbol. You can resume testing at a later date by locating the test run on your 'My Page' under 'My Pending Test Runs' and choosing to resume testing. Note that the system will remember every result you have logged, along with the last test step you were working so you can pick up right where you left off.</li> <li>Finish button: once either all steps in a test have an execution status recorded, or at least one step has been recorded with any status other than \"Pass\" the test run can be finished. An orange with a stop symbol will appear (see below). Clicking this button will give you two options. \"Update Test Case\" will update the test case execution status, and also change its name, description, and test steps to reflect those on this page (adding, deleting, moving, editing as necessary). \"Just Finish\" will only change the execution status of the test case only---leaving all details of the test case unchanged. Either option will archive the entire test run (so it can no longer be amended) and the page will automatically exit the test execution page.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Options: the right most button on the toolbar gives additional options for customizing the page.

Spira looks for the most recent time each test case was run against release \"bravo\". Let's imagine that the most recent test run of each test case in the test set are: 14 March, 23 February, and 2 March. The test set's last execution date will be 23 February because it is the earliest date of the three.</p> <p>In this way, the last execution date field can help test managers identify potentially outdated test runs of the test set more easily.

In addition these parameters may be used by certain test automation engines.</p> <p>The Parameters section on the test set page lets you set a shared value for all of the parameters contained within the different test cases of the test set. The screenshot below shows that there are three parameters contained in the test cases that have been set at the test set level.

These steps take the artifact from its creation to its end point. Workflows give you control about the who, how, and what of moving an artifact through specific steps.</p> <p>For example, a task going from not done to done. In SpiraPlan the task starts as \"Not Started\" and transitions through the workflow steps to \"Completed\".

So why do all 4 requirements show a filled in task progress bar? This is because of a feature called \"rollup\". The task progress from a requirement's children \"rollup\" to the parent. The task progress bar of \"Prepare the spaceship\" is a rolled up combination of the task progress of its two children.</p> <p>Why are 3 of the task progress bars yellow? Because the tasks have start dates in the past and have not yet started. In SpiraPlan we consider these tasks to be \"starting late\". We never directly set their start dates, but the tasks got their start and end dates from the releases (sprints) they are linked to. The remaining task progress bar is gray because, although it too is still not started, its start date is in the future.

These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.</p> <p></p> <p>Git doesn't think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn't store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots:</p> <p></p> <p>This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS.</p> <p>Another major difference between Git and Subversion is that Git has built-in support for 'branches' instead of relying on a specific folder structure. In Git, Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the \"default\" branch when you create a repository.

The reporter subfolder contains two NodeJS modules:</p> <ul> <li> <p>SpiraReporter.js -- this contains the Mocha custom reporter used for sending the results to SpiraTest</p> </li> <li> <p>SpiraClient.js -- this contains the JavaScript module that sends a test result back to SpiraTest. It is used by SpiraReporter.js but can also be used directly in your code if you want to report back results without using Mocha.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To use this custom reporter with your Mocha test framework, you simply need to do these two things:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Add the reporter name to the command line used to invoke Mocha</p> </li> <li> <p>Add some configuration code to your UnitJS test suite to tell Mocha how to connect to your instance of SpiraTest.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The first part is very straightforward, just add the Reporter to your Mocha command line:</p> <p>node ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha .\\test\\example2.js --reporter .\\reporter\\SpiraReporter</p> <p>For the second part, you need to add the following code to your test suite at the top:</p> <p><pre><code>var SpiraReporter = require('../reporter/SpiraReporter.js');\n\n//set the SpiraTest options\n\nglobal.spiraOptions = {\n\nprojectId: 1,\n\ntestCaseId: 4,\n\nreleaseId: 1,\n\ntestSetId: null,\n\nlogin: 'fredbloggs',\n\napiKey: '{7A05FD06-83C3-4436-B37F-51BCF0060483}',\n\nprotocol: 'http',\n\nhost: '127.0.0.1',\n\nvdir: 'spira'\n\n};\n</code></pre> The first line simply adds a reference to the SpiraTest Mocha reporter module.</p> <p>The second line defines the connection and test case information used for reporting back to SpiraTest. Here's what you need to put in each of the required configuration options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>protocol -- this needs to be set to either \"http\" or \"https\" depending on how you connect to SpiraTest</p> </li> <li> <p>host -- this needs to be the name or IP address of the host running SpiraTest. For cloud customers, it will be something like mycompany.spiraservice.net</p> </li> <li> <p>port -- this is usually 80 for http and 443 for https unless you are running SpiraTest on a custom port</p> </li> <li> <p>vdir -- this is the name of any path used after the hostname. For example, if your URL is https://demo.spiraservice.net/mysite then the vdir would be \"mysite\". If your URL is just https://mycompany.spiraservice.net then you can leave the vdir blank or just not set a value for it.</p> </li> <li> <p>login -- this should be a login that has access to the project in SpiraTest with permissions to create test runs.</p> </li> <li> <p>apiKey -- this should be the API Key (also known as the RSS Token) for the login specified</p> </li> <li> <p>projectId -- this should be the numeric ID of the project that the test case belongs to (e.g. if the project is PR56 just use 56)</p> </li> <li> <p>testCaseId -- this should be the numeric ID of the test case that you want this Mocha test suite to report against (e.g. if the test case in question is TC23 just use 23)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, there are two optional configuration parameters you can use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>releaseId -- If you would like the recorded test run to be reported against a specific release, iteration or phase in SpiraTest, you need to specify the ID of the release in question (e.g. for release RL18 just use 18)</p> </li> <li> <p>testSetId - If you would like the recorded test run to be reported against a specific test set in SpiraTest, you need to specify the ID of the test set in question (e.g. for test set TX35 just use 35)</p> </li> </ul> <p>With those values set, when you run the test suite using the command line:</p> <p>node ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha .\\test\\example2.js --reporter .\\reporter\\SpiraReporter</p> <p>The results of the test suite will be displayed inside the Mocha console:</p> <p></p> <p>When you login to SpiraTest and view the test case being executed, you will now see the automated test runs reported back from Mocha:</p> <p></p> <p>Clicking on one of the MochaJS Reporter test runs will bring up a screen that provides the detailed test run report from Mocha:</p> <p></p> <p>The Console Output section gives more detailed information:</p> <p></p> <p>Congratulations...

It assumes that you already have a working installation of SpiraTest v5.0 or later. If you have an earlier version of SpiraTest you will need to upgrade to at least v5.0 before trying to use this extension. You will also need to have at least version 5.0 of Junit. If you are using an earlier version, please visit www.junit.org to obtain the latest version.</p> <p>To obtain the version of the JUnit extension that is compatible with your version of SpiraTest, you simply need to log-in as a project-level administrator to SpiraTest, go to the Administration home page and download the JUnit Extension compressed archive (.zip). This process is described in the SpiraTest Administration Guide in more detail.</p> <p>The JUnit extension is provided as a compressed zipfile that includes both the binaries (packaged as a JAR-file) and the source code (stored in a folder structure that mirrors the Java classpath). The JAR-file binary was compiled for use on a Windows x86 platform, other platforms (e.g. Linux) will require you to compile the Java source files into the appropriate Java classfiles before using the extension. The rest of this section will assume that you are using the pre-compiled JAR-file.</p> <p>Once you have downloaded the Zip archive, you need to uncompress it into a folder of your choice on your local system. Assuming that you uncompressed it to the C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension folder, you should have the following folder structure created:</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\junitextension</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\junitextension\\samples</p> <p>The JAR-file is located in the root folder, the source-code for the extension can be found in the \"junitextension\" subfolder, and the sample test fixture can be found in the \"samples\" subfolder.</p> <p>Now to use the extension within your test cases, you need to first make sure that the JAR-file is added to the Java classpath. The method for doing this is dependent on the platform you're using, so please refer to FAQ on www.junit.org for details on the appropriate method for your platform. As an example, on a Windows platform, the JAR-file would be added to the classpath by typing the following:</p> <p><code>set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; C:\\\\Program Files\\\\JUnit Extension\\\\JUnitExtension.jar</code></p> <p>Once you have completed this step, you are now ready to begin using your JUnit test fixtures with SpiraTest.</p>"},{"location":"Unit-Testing-Integration/Integrating-with-JUnit/#using-junit-5-with-spiratest","title":"Using JUnit 5 with SpiraTest","text":"<p>The typical code structure for a JUnit test fixture coded in Java is as follows:</p> <pre><code>package com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.junitextension.samples;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;\n\n\n/**\n * Some simple tests using the ability to return results back to SpiraTest\n *\n * @author Inflectra Corporation\n * @version 4.0.0\n */\npublic class SimpleTest {\n    protected int fValue1;\n    protected int fValue2;\n\n    /**\n     * Sets up the unit test\n     */\n    @BeforeEach\n    public void setUp() {\n        fValue1 = 2;\n        fValue2 = 3;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests the addition of the two values\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testAdd() {\n        double result = fValue1 + fValue2;\n\n        // forced failure result == 5\n        assertTrue(result == 6);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests division by zero\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testDivideByZero() {\n        int zero = 0;\n        int result = 8 / zero;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests two equal values\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testEquals() {\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n        assertEquals(12L, 12L);\n        assertEquals(new Long(12), new Long(12));\n\n        assertEquals(12, 13, \"Size\");\n        assertEquals(12.0, 11.99, 0.0, \"Capacity\");\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests success\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testSuccess() {\n        //Successful test\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The Java class is marked as a JUnit test fixture by applying the <code>@BeforeEach</code> attribute to the setup method, and the <code>@Test</code> attribute to each of the test assertion methods individually -- highlighted in yellow above.

It assumes that you already have a working installation of SpiraTest v3.0 or later. If you have an earlier version of SpiraTest you will need to upgrade to at least v3.0 before trying to use this extension. You will also need to have version 4.0 of JUnit. To use version 5.0 of JUnit, please visit Installing the JUnit 5 Extension</p> <p>To obtain the version of the JUnit extension that is compatible with your version of SpiraTest, you simply need to log-in as a project-level administrator to SpiraTest, go to the Administration home page and download the JUnit Extension compressed archive (.zip). This process is described in the SpiraTest Administration Guide in more detail.</p> <p>The JUnit extension is provided as a compressed zipfile that includes both the binaries (packaged as a JAR-file) and the source code (stored in a folder structure that mirrors the Java classpath). The JAR-file binary was compiled for use on a Windows x86 platform, other platforms (e.g. Linux) will require you to compile the Java source files into the appropriate Java classfiles before using the extension. The rest of this section will assume that you are using the pre-compiled JAR-file.</p> <p>Once you have downloaded the Zip archive, you need to uncompress it into a folder of your choice on your local system. Assuming that you uncompressed it to the C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension folder, you should have the following folder structure created:</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\junitextension</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\junitextension\\samples</p> <p>The JAR-file is located in the root folder, the source-code for the extension can be found in the \"junitextension\" subfolder, and the sample test fixture can be found in the \"samples\" subfolder.</p> <p>Now to use the extension within your test cases, you need to first make sure that the JAR-file is added to the Java classpath. The method for doing this is dependent on the platform you're using, so please refer to FAQ on www.junit.org for details on the appropriate method for your platform. As an example, on a Windows platform, the JAR-file would be added to the classpath by typing the following:</p> <p>set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; C:\\Program Files\\JUnit Extension\\JUnitExtension.jar</p> <p>Once you have completed this step, you are now ready to begin using your JUnit test fixtures with SpiraTest.</p>"},{"location":"Unit-Testing-Integration/Integrating-with-JUnit/#using-junit-4-with-spiratest","title":"Using JUnit 4 with SpiraTest","text":"<p>The typical code structure for a JUnit test fixture coded in Java is as follows:</p> <pre><code>package com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.junitextension.samples;\n\nimport static org.junit.Assert.*;\nimport junit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapter;\nimport org.junit.Before;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.runner.*;\nimport org.junit.runner.notification.*;\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\n/**\n * Some simple tests using JUnit 4\n * \n * @author      Inflectra Corporation\n * @version     2.3.0\n *\n */\npublic class SimpleTest\n{\n    protected int fValue1;\n    protected int fValue2;\n\n    /**\n     * Sets up the unit test\n     */\n    @Before\n    public void setUp()\n    {\n        fValue1= 2;\n        fValue2= 3;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests the addition of the two values\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testAdd()\n    {\n        double result = fValue1 + fValue2;\n\n        // forced failure result == 5\n        assertTrue (result == 6);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests division by zero\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testDivideByZero()\n    {\n        int zero = 0;\n        int result = 8 / zero;\n        result++; // avoid warning for not using result\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests two equal values\n     */\n    @Test\n\n    public void testEquals()\n    {\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n        assertEquals(12L, 12L);\n        assertEquals(new Long(12), new Long(12));\n\n        assertEquals(\"Size\", 12, 13);\n        assertEquals(\"Capacity\", 12.0, 11.99, 0.0);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests success\n     */\n    @Test\n    public void testSuccess()\n    {\n        //Successful test\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Entry point for command line execution\n     * \n     * @param args  The command line arguments\n     */\n    public static void main (String[] args)\n    {\n        //Instantiate the JUnit core\n        JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();\n\n        //Finally run the test fixture\n        core.run (SimpleTest.class);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Entry point for JUnit 4.x runners\n     * \n     * @return      Handle to the test framework\n     */\n    public static junit.framework.Test suite() \n    {\n        return new JUnit4TestAdapter(SimpleTest.class);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The Java class is marked as a JUnit test fixture by applying the @Before attribute to the setup method, and the @Test attribute to each of the test assertion methods individually -- highlighted in yellow above.

If you have an earlier version of SpiraTest you will need to upgrade to at least v2.3 before trying to use this add-in. You will also need to have either Visual Studio Team System 2005 or later or Visual Studio 2008 Professional or later, since earlier versions do not come with the test automation features.</p> <p>To obtain the latest version of the SpiraTest extension, you can either access the administration section of SpiraTest, and click on the Add-Ins &amp; Downloads link or simply visit the Inflectra corporate downloads webpage (http://www.inflectra.com/Products/Downloads.aspx) and then download the compressed archive (.zip) that contains the extension and associated sample files.</p> <p>The MS-Test extension is provided as a compressed zipfile that includes both the binaries (packaged as a .NET dll assembly) and the source code (stored in a Visual Studio project folder structure). The rest of this section will assume that you are using the pre-compiled assembly.</p> <p>Once you have downloaded the Zip archive, you need to uncompress it into a folder of your choice on your local system.

Any combination of the 2 test case ID assignment methods can be used, and will not block the other one from working. The TestCaseId property assigned in test code will take priority over TestCaseId's assigned through the JSON file. If a test case id cannot be found for a given method in either of these locations and there is no default, a warning will be logged above the NUnit test summary which says which method was not reported to Spira.</p> <p>In the credentials group you must specify:</p> <ul> <li>url -- The base url to your SpiraPlan installation, without a '/' at the end.</li> <li>username -- The username you use to sign into SpiraTest.</li> <li>token -- Your RSS Token. Found in your profile page as the \"RSS Token\" field, you must have RSS Feeds enabled for this to work.</li> <li>project_id -- The ID of the project you would like the test runs to be sent to</li> <li>release_id -- OPTIONAL -- Use if you would like to associate the test run with a release.</li> <li>test_set_id -- OPTIONAL -- Use if you would like to associate the test run with a test set.</li> </ul> <p>In the test_cases group, put the following:</p> <ul> <li>default -- The default test case ID for functions without an assigned test case</li> <li>{method name} - Used to override the default setting above by providing the specific test case id for each method in your NUnit fixture(s).</li> </ul> <p>Good practice tips</p> <p>You can have multiple SpiraConfig.json files - one per subfolder in your projects's unit test folder, for example. This can help with maintenance of the json file.</p> <p>However, when running the test cases it will likely be easier and less error prone to have a single SpiraConfig.json folder for every test in every fixture.

These can be either existing test cases that have manual test steps or they can be new test cases designed specifically for automated testing and therefore have no defined test steps. In either case, no changes need to be made to the individual test cases, but the following changes need to be made to the test harness (illustrated in yellow below):</p> <p>#this is a test case that tests addition operations</p> <p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</p> <p>use Inflectra::SpiraTest::Addons::SpiraHarness::Harness;</p> <p>#instantiate the harness</p> <p>my $harness = Inflectra::SpiraTest::Addons::SpiraHarness::Harness-&gt;new;</p> <p>#specify the spiratest custom harness properties</p> <p>$spira_args = {};</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"base_url\"} = \"http://localhost/SpiraTest\";</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"user_name\"} = \"fredbloggs\";</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"password\"} = \"fredbloggs\";</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"project_id\"} = 1;</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"release_id\"} = 1;</p> <p>$spira_args-&gt;{\"test_set_id\"} = 1;</p> <p>$harness-&gt;{\"spira_args\"} = $spira_args;</p> <p>#define the list of tests and their SpiraTest Mapping</p> <p>#Hash is of the format: TestFile =&gt; Test Case ID</p> <p>my $tests = {};</p> <p>$tests-&gt;{\"SampleTest1.pl\"} = 2;</p> <p>$tests-&gt;{\"SampleTest2.pl\"} = 3;</p> <p>harness-\\&gt;runtests(tests);</p> <p>Firstly you need to use the SpiraTest specific harness rather than the general TAP::Harness library.

If you have an earlier version of SpiraTest you will need to upgrade to at least v2.3 before trying to use this extension.</p> <p>To obtain the version of the Test::Unit test runner that is compatible with your version of SpiraTest, you simply need to log-in as a project-level administrator to SpiraTest, go to the Administration home page and download the Test::Unit test runner compressed archive (.zip).

When you open up the class in a Ruby Test::Unit runner or execute from the command line it loads all the test classes and executes all the methods marked with 'test...' in turn.</p> <p>Each of the Assert statements is used to test the state of the application after executing some sample code that calls the functionality being tested. If the condition in the assertion is true, then execution of the test continues, if it is false, then a failure is logged and Test::Unit moves on to the next test method.</p> <p>So, to use SpiraTest with Test::Unit, each of the test cases written for execution by Test::Unit needs to have a corresponding test case in SpiraTest. These can be either existing test cases that have manual test steps or they can be new test cases designed specifically for automated testing and therefore have no defined test steps. In either case, the changes that need to be made to the Test::Unit test case and test suite for SpiraTest to record the Test::Unit test run are illustrated below:</p> <p>#this is a test case that tests addition operations</p> <p>class TC_Adder &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase</p> <p>def setup</p> <p>@adder = Adder.new(5)</p> <p>end</p> <p>def test_add__2</p> <p>assert_equal(7, @adder.add(2), \"Should have added correctly\")</p> <p>end</p> <p>def test_addfail__3</p> <p>assert_equal(7, @adder.add(3), \"Test failure\")</p> <p>end</p> <p>def teardown</p> <p>@adder = nil</p> <p>end</p> <p>end</p> <p>#this is a test suite that calls the test case</p> <p>class TS_Examples</p> <p>def self.suite</p> <p>suite = Test::Unit::TestSuite.new</p> <p>suite &lt;&lt; TC_Adder.suite</p> <p>return suite</p> <p>end</p> <p>end</p> <p>projectId = 1</p> <p>releaseId = 2</p> <p>testSetId = -1</p> <p>testRunner = Test::Unit::SpiraTest::TestRunner.new(TS_Examples, \"http://servername/SpiraTest\", \"fredbloggs\", \"fredbloggs\", projectId, releaseId, testSetId)</p> <p>testRunner.start</p> <p>Firstly, each of the individual test methods is appended with two underscores followed by the ID of the corresponding test case in SpiraTest. So for example test_add is now test_add__2 as it maps to test case TC00002 inside SpiraTest.</p> <p>Second, at the end of the test suite, instead of just creating the standard Console Test Runner class and passing it a reference to the test suite (e.g. TS_Examples), we now create an instance of the special Test::Unit::SpiraTest::TestRunner class, passing it a reference to the test suite as well as specifying the SpiraTest connection information.</p> <p>This class takes the results from the test suite being executed and uses it to generate the web-service messages that are sent to SpiraTest to communicate the test results.</p> <p>The following parameters need to be passed during the instantiation of the Test::Unit::SpiraTest::TestRunner object so that the custom test runner can access the SpiraTest repository:</p> <p>suite -- the reference to the Test::Unit test suite that contains the test cases being executed. In our example above, this is the TS_Examples class.</p> <p>baseUrl-- The base URL used to access your instance of SpiraTest (e.g. http://myserver/SpiraTest). It should include the protocol (e.g. http/https), the server-name, the port number (if not 80/443) and the virtual directory (if there is one).</p> <p>userName - A valid username for the instance of SpiraTest that has access to the project specified above</p> <p>password - A valid password for the user specified above</p> <p>projectId - The ID of the project inside SpiraTest (this can be found on the project homepage in the \"Project Overview\" section)</p> <p>releaseId - The ID of the SpiraTest release to associate the test run with. This can be found on the releases list page (click on the Planning &gt; Releases tab). If you don't want to associate the test run with a specific release, just use the value -1 to indicate N/A.</p> <p>testSetId - The ID of the SpiraTest test set to associate the test run with. This can be found on the test set list page (click on the Testing &gt; Test Sets tab). If you don't want to associate the test run with a specific test set, just use the value -1 to indicate N/A.</p> <p>Now all you need to do is save your code, launch Test::Unit, run the test fixtures as you would normally do (e.g. by executing the TS_Examples ruby file from the command line), and when you view the test cases in SpiraTest, you should see a Ruby Test::Unit automated test run displayed in the list of executed test runs:</p> <p></p> <p>Clicking on one of the Ruby Test::Unit test runs will bring up a screen that provides information regarding what Ruby Test::Unit test method failed, what the error was, together with the associated code stack-trace:</p> <p></p> <p>Congratulations... You are now able to run Test::Unit automated tests and have the results be recorded within SpiraTest.

Assuming that you uncompressed it to the C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener folder, you should have the following folder structure created:</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\com</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\com\\inflectra</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\testnglistener</p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\Extension\\com\\inflectra\\spiratest\\addons\\testnglistener\\samples</p> <p>The JAR-file is located in the root folder, the source-code for the extension can be found in the \"testnglistener\" subfolder, and the sample test fixture can be found in the \"samples\" subfolder.</p> <p>Now to use the listener within your test cases, you need to first make sure that the JAR-file is added to the Java classpath. The method for doing this is dependent on the platform you're using, so please refer to FAQ on www.testngorg for details on the appropriate method for your platform. As an example, on a Windows platform, the JAR-file would be added to the classpath by typing the following:</p> <p>set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%; C:\\Program Files\\SpiraTestListener\\TestNGListener.jar</p> <p>Once you have completed this step, you are now ready to begin using your TestNG test fixtures with SpiraTest.</p>"},{"location":"Unit-Testing-Integration/Integrating-with-TestNG/#using-testng-with-spiratest","title":"Using TestNG with SpiraTest","text":"<p>The typical code structure for a TestNG test fixture coded in Java is as follows:</p> <pre><code>package com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.testnglistener.samples;\n\nimport org.testng.annotations.*;\nimport static org.testng.AssertJUnit.*;\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\n/**\n * Some simple tests using the ability to return results back to SpiraTest\n * \n * @author      Inflectra Corporation\n * @version     2.3.0\n *\n */\n@Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\npublic class SimpleTest\n{\n    protected int fValue1;\n    protected int fValue2;\n\n    /**\n     * Sets up the unit test\n     */\n    @BeforeClass\n    public void setUp()\n    {\n        fValue1= 2;\n        fValue2= 3;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests the addition of the two values\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    public void testAdd()\n    {\n        double result = fValue1 + fValue2;\n\n        // forced failure result == 5\n        assertTrue (result == 6);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests division by zero\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    public void testDivideByZero()\n    {\n        int zero = 0;\n        int result = 8 / zero;\n        result++; // avoid warning for not using result\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests two equal values\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    public void testEquals()\n    {\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n        assertEquals(12L, 12L);\n        assertEquals(new Long(12), new Long(12));\n\n        assertEquals(\"Size\", 12, 13);\n        assertEquals(\"Capacity\", 12.0, 11.99, 0.0);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests success\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    public void testSuccess()\n    {\n        //Successful test\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The Java class is marked as a TestNG test fixture by applying the @Test attribute to the class definition, and the @Test attribute to each of the test assertion methods individually -- highlighted in yellow above. In addition, special setup methods are marked with annotations such as @BeforeClass. When you open up the class in a TestNG runner or execute from the command line it loads all the test classes and executes all the methods marked with @Test in turn.</p> <p>Each of the Assert statements is used to test the state of the application after executing some sample code that calls the functionality being tested. If the condition in the assertion is true, then execution of the test continues, if it is false, then a failure is logged and TestNG moves on to the next test method.</p> <p>So, to use SpiraTest with TestNG, each of the test cases written for execution by TestNG needs to have a corresponding test case in SpiraTest. These can be either existing test cases that have manual test steps or they can be new test cases designed specifically for automated testing and therefore have no defined test steps. In either case, the changes that need to be made to the TestNG test fixture for SpiraTest to record the TestNG test run are illustrated below:</p> <pre><code>package com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.testnglistener.samples;\n\nimport org.testng.annotations.*;\nimport static org.testng.AssertJUnit.*;\n\nimport com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.testnglistener.*;\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\n/**\n * Some simple tests using the ability to return results back to SpiraTest\n * \n * @author      Inflectra Corporation\n * @version     2.3.0\n *\n */\n@SpiraTestConfiguration(\n    url=\"http://localhost/SpiraTest\",\n    login=\"fredbloggs\",\n    apiKey=\"{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\",\n    projectId=1,\n    releaseId=1,\n    testSetId=-1\n)\n@Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\npublic class SimpleTest\n{\n    protected int fValue1;\n    protected int fValue2;\n\n    /**\n     * Sets up the unit test\n     */\n    @BeforeClass\n    public void setUp()\n    {\n        fValue1= 2;\n        fValue2= 3;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests the addition of the two values\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    @SpiraTestCase(testCaseId=5)\n    public void testAdd()\n    {\n        double result = fValue1 + fValue2;\n\n        // forced failure result == 5\n        assertTrue (result == 6);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests division by zero\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    @SpiraTestCase(testCaseId=5)\n    public void testDivideByZero()\n    {\n        int zero = 0;\n        int result = 8 / zero;\n        result++; // avoid warning for not using result\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests two equal values\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    @SpiraTestCase(testCaseId=6)\n    public void testEquals()\n    {\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n        assertEquals(12L, 12L);\n        assertEquals(new Long(12), new Long(12));\n\n        assertEquals(\"Size\", 12, 13);\n        assertEquals(\"Capacity\", 12.0, 11.99, 0.0);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Tests success\n     */\n    @Test(groups={\"unittest\"})\n    @SpiraTestCase(testCaseId=6)\n    public void testSuccess()\n    {\n        //Successful test\n        assertEquals(12, 12);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The overall class is marked with a new @SpiraTestConfiguration attribute that contains the following pieces of information needed to access the SpiraTest test repository:</p> <p>URL - The URL to the instance of SpiraTest being accessed.

This can be found on the test set list page (click on the Testing &gt; Test Sets tab). If you don't want to specify a test set, just use the value -1. If you choose a test set that is associated with a release, then you don't need to explicitly set a release id (i.e. just use -1). However if you do set a release value, it will override the value associated with the test set.</p> <p>In addition, each of the individual test methods needs to be mapped to a specific test case within SpiraTest. This is done by adding a @SpiraTestCase attribute to the test method together with the ID of the corresponding test case in SpiraTest. The Test Case ID can be found on the test cases list page (click the \"Test Cases\" tab).</p> <p>For these attributes to be available in your test fixture, you also need to add a reference to the com.inflectra.spiratest.addons.testnglistener package.

You can re-generate your RSS / API Key by going to your user page in SpiraPlan. Always remember to click 'Save' after re-generating your RSS key. If the problem persists, ask your SpiraPlan administrator to check the SpiraPlan API CORS configuration (in SpiraPlan: Admin menu &gt; System &gt; Security Settings &gt; Allowed Domains) to see if it is accepting connections from the add-in domain.</p> <p>2. When importing data from a spreadsheet on my computer, I get error messages. How do I solve it?</p> <p>Here is a list of possible error messages you may see when importing a spreadsheet into the add-in and how to solve them:</p> <p><code>Error: The selected product does not match the Spreadsheet data.</code></p> <p>Solution: You cannot run Tests from one product and record them in another product. In the add-in, select the same product of the saved spreadsheet and try again.</p> <p><code>Error: Database sheet is missing.</code></p> <p>Solution: Your spreadsheet is missing required data. You have to re-import (using the \"Get From Spira\" button) the data. Never delete/rename any worksheet from the spreadsheet.</p> <p><code>Error: There are columns missing in the spreadsheet.</code></p> <p>Solution: Your worksheet is missing required data. You have to re-import (using the \"Get From Spira\" button) the data. Never delete or rename any column from the worksheet.</p> <p><code>Error: Invalid Test Case detected: missing Test Step(s).</code></p> <p>Solution: Your worksheet is missing Test Case data. You have to re-import (using the \"Get From Spira\" button) the data. You can delete Test Cases from the worksheet, but make sure to not leave Test Sets with no Test Cases or Test Cases with no Test Steps.</p> <p>3.

A valid Test Run is one that meets the conditions below. Check to make sure your test case meets all of these. In particular, review any Test Steps that have an execution status of Not Run still.</p> <ul> <li>If at least one Test Step has an Execution Status of Failed, Blocked, or Caution then all other Test Steps can be left as Not Run</li> <li>Otherwise, every Test Step must have an Execution Status other than Not Run (in other words Passed or N/A)</li> </ul> <p>4. After clicking on 'Send to Spira', I see a Test Step red row and an error message saying...</p> <p><code>Missing Actual Result: This TestStep needs to have an Actual Result, since it failed.</code></p> <p>How to solve this issue: all Test Steps that are run but not passed (steps marked as any of Failed, Blocked, Caution, or N/A) must have an Actual Result. Check your non-passed Test Steps and make sure they all have an actual result and try again.</p> <p>5.
