<h1 id="using-spiratest-with-ms-tfs">Using SpiraTest with MS-TFS</h1>
<p>This section outlines how to use SpiraTest, SpiraPlan or SpiraTeam
(hereafter referred to as SpiraTeam) in conjunction with the work item
tracking functionality of Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services
(MS-VSTS), Visual Studio Online (VSO), or Microsoft Team Foundation
Server (TFS) hereafter referred to as TFS.</p>
<p>The built-in integration service allows the quality assurance team to
manage their requirements and test cases in SpiraTeam, execute test runs
in SpiraTest, and then have the new incidents generated during the run
be automatically loaded into TFS. Once the incidents are loaded into TFS
as work items, the development team can then manage the lifecycle of
these work items in TFS, and have the status changes in TFS be reflected
back in SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>Similarly, as the requirements are decomposed into discrete project
tasks in SpiraTeam, the integration service will automatically load
these new tasks into TFS as task work items where the development team
can manage their lifecycle, with schedule and progress changes in TFS
being reflected back in SpiraTeam.</p>
<p><strong>STOP! Please make sure you have first read the Instructions in 
<a href="../Setting-up-Data-Synchronization/">Setup</a> before proceeding!</strong></p>
<p>► Note: Only the MS-TFS 2012+ Plug-In is Available on the Inflectra
Cloud-Based DataSync Service.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-plug-in">Configuring the Plug-In</h2>
<p>The next step is to configure the plug-in within SpiraTeam so that the
system knows how to access the TFS server. To start the configuration,
please open up SpiraTeam in a web browser, log in using a valid account
that has System-Administration level privileges and click on the System
> Data Synchronization administration option from the left-hand
navigation:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_77.png" /></p>
<p>This screen lists all the plug-ins already configured in the system.
Depending on whether you chose the option to include sample data in your
installation or not, you will see either an empty screen or a list of
sample data-synchronization plug-ins.</p>
<p>If you already see an entry for <strong>MsTfsDataSync</strong> you should click on
its "Edit" link. If you don't see such an entry in the list, please
click on the [Add] button instead. In either case you will be taken to
the following screen where you can enter or modify the TFS
Data-Synchronization plug-in:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_78.png" /></p>
<p>You need to fill out the following fields for the TFS Plug-in to operate
correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> -- this needs to be set to <strong>MsTfsDataSync</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caption</strong> -- this is the display name of the plugin. Normally you
can use something generic such as "Microsoft TFS", however if you
have multiple TFS instances you might want to name it something
specific such as "TFS External". If you don't enter a value, the
display name will be "MsTfsDataSync"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong> -- this should be set to a description of the
plug-in. This is an optional field that is used for documentation
purposes and is not actually used by the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection Info</strong> -- this should the URL that you use for
connecting Visual Studio to the Team Foundation Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Visual Studio Online</strong>, it is of the format
<a href="https://mycompany.visualstudio.com">https://mycompany.visualstudio.com</a>. See our special <a href="https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB213.aspx">KB213
regarding Visual Studio
Online</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For TFS 2010+</strong> it is of the format
<a href="http://servername:8080/tfs/collectionname">http://servername:8080/tfs/collectionname</a> where
"collectionname" is the name of the project collection you're
integrating with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For TFS 2005/2008</strong> it is of the format
<a href="http://servername:8080">http://servername:8080</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Login</strong> -- this should be set to a valid user that has permissions
to access the TFS installation. The login needs to have permissions
to create and view work items and iterations within TFS.
Note: Do not include the Windows Active Directory Domain in this
field if you are using a Windows domain user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password</strong> -- this should be set to the password of the user
specified above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Offset</strong> -- normally this should be set to zero, but if you
find that work items being changed in TFS are not being updated in
SpiraTeam, try increasing the value as this will tell the
data-synchronization plug-in to add on the time offset (in hours)
when comparing date-time stamps. Also if your TFS installation is
running on a server set to a different time-zone, then you should
add in the number of hours difference between the servers'
time-zones here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Visual Studio Online (VSO) instead of a local TFS
instance, you will need to login to the instance of Visual Studio Online
and access your profile:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_79.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the Security Option. Then in the user security menu, choose the
option to enter 'Alternate Credentials'. You need to now enter a login
and password that SpiraTeam will use to connect to VSO:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_80.png" /></p>
<p>The remaining fields work differently depending on which version of the
TFS plugin you are using (2012, 2010 or 2005/2008):</p>
<p>a) TFS 2012 Plugin</p>
<p>Please fill out the fields as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Map Users</strong> -- This changes the way the plugin maps users in
SpiraTeam to those in TFS:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Map = True
</strong>With this setting, all users in SpiraTeam need to have the
same username as those in TFS. If this is the case then you do
not need to perform the user-mapping task outlined in section
5.2.2. This is a big time-saver if you can guarantee that all
usernames are the same in both systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Map = False
</strong>With this setting, users in SpiraTeam and TFS are free to have
different usernames because you specify the corresponding TFS
name for each user as outlined in 5.2.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 01</strong> -- This is used to specify the Windows Active
Directory Domain that the Windows user specified above is a member
of. If you are running TFS on a Windows workgroup, just use the
server name and make sure that the Windows user above is a user on
that server itself. If you are using a Window Live ID, just leave
this field blank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 02</strong> -- This field should contain a comma-separated list of
work item types that you want to synchronize as SpiraTeam Tasks as
opposed to Incidents. Normally you would want to list at least the
TFS "Task" work item type in this field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 03</strong> -- If you would like the system to display the
SpiraTeam artifact ID (e.g. IN5 for incidents or TK36 for tasks) in
a custom field inside TFS, you should just enter the name of the
appropriate TFS field from your process template (e.g.
Spira.IncidentId) and then when the incident or task is added to
TFS, the corresponding SpiraTeam ID will be added to that field of
the work item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 04</strong> - Depending on your TFS process template, the
data-synchronization plugin may not be allowed to set the detector
of the incident inside TFS. If you would like the system to display
the detector of the incident (as recorded in SpiraTeam) in a custom
field inside TFS, you should just enter the name of the appropriate
TFS field from your process template (e.g. Spira.Detector) and then
when the incident is added to TFS, the corresponding detector's name
will be added to that field of the work item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 05</strong> -- This field should contain a comma-separated list of
work item types that you want to synchronize as SpiraTeam
Requirements as opposed to Incidents. Normally you would want to
list at least the TFS "User Story" work item type in this field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>b) TFS 2010 Plugin</p>
<p>Please fill out the fields as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Map Users</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin
and can be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 01</strong> -- This is used to specify the Windows Active
Directory Domain that the Windows user specified above is a member
of. If you are running TFS on a Windows workgroup, just use the
server name and make sure that the Windows user above is a user on
that server itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 02</strong> -- This is used to specify if you want to synchronize
Incidents, Tasks or Both. By default this field is blank, meaning
synchronize both types of artifact. However if you enter in
"<em>Incidents</em>" into this field it will tell the system to only
synchronize incidents, and if you enter "<em>Tasks</em>" it will tell the
system to only synchronize tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 03</strong> -- If you would like the system to display the
SpiraTeam artifact ID (e.g. IN5 for incidents or TK36 for tasks) in
a custom field inside TFS, you should just enter the name of the
appropriate TFS field from your process template (e.g.
Spira.IncidentId) and then when the incident or task is added to
TFS, the corresponding SpiraTeam ID will be added to that field of
the work item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 04</strong> - Depending on your TFS process template, the
data-synchronization plugin may not be allowed to set the detector
of the incident inside TFS. If you would like the system to display
the detector of the incident (as recorded in SpiraTeam) in a custom
field inside TFS, you should just enter the name of the appropriate
TFS field from your process template (e.g. Spira.Detector) and then
when the incident is added to TFS, the corresponding detector's name
will be added to that field of the work item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 05</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin and
can be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>c) TFS 2005/2008 Plugin</p>
<p>Please fill out the fields as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Map Users</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin
and can be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 01</strong> -- This is used to specify the Windows Active
Directory Domain that the Windows user specified above is a member
of. If you are running TFS on a Windows workgroup, just use the
server name and make sure that the Windows user above is a user on
that server itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 02</strong> -- This is used to specify if you want to synchronize
Incidents, Tasks or Both. By default this field is blank, meaning
synchronize both types of artifact. However if you enter in
"<em>Incidents</em>" into this field it will tell the system to only
synchronize incidents, and if you enter "<em>Tasks</em>" it will tell the
system to only synchronize tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 03</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin and
can be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 04</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin and
can be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom 05</strong> -- this is not used by this version of the plugin and
can be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-the-data-mapping">Configuring the Data Mapping</h2>
<p>Next, you need to configure the data mapping between SpiraTeam and TFS.
This allows the various projects, users, releases, incident types,
statuses, priorities and custom property values used in the two
applications to be related to each other. This is important, as without
a correct mapping, there is no way for the integration service to know
that a "Not Reproducible" incident in SpiraTeam is the same as a "Closed
+ Cannot Reproduce" bug work item in TFS (for example).</p>
<p>The following mapping information needs to be setup in SpiraTeam:</p>
<p>The mapping of the project identifiers for the projects that need to be
synchronized</p>
<p>The mapping of <em>users</em> in the system</p>
<p>The mapping of <em>releases</em> (equivalent to TFS iterations) in the system</p>
<p>The mapping of the various standard <em>incident</em> fields in the system</p>
<p>The mapping of the various custom <em>incident</em> properties in the system</p>
<p>The mapping of the various standard <em>requirement</em> fields in the system
(if synching requirements)</p>
<p>The mapping of the various custom <em>requirement</em> properties in the system
(if synching requirements)</p>
<p>The mapping of the various standard <em>task</em> fields in the system (if
synching tasks)</p>
<p>The mapping of the various custom <em>task</em> properties in the system (if
synching tasks)</p>
<p><em>Note: If using SpiraTest, you do not need to setup the last two sets of
mappings as Tasks are not available in SpiraTest.</em></p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-project-mapping">Configuring the Project Mapping</h3>
<p>From the data synchronization administration page, you need to click on
the "View Project Mappings" hyperlink next to the TFS plug-in name. This
will take you to the data-mapping home page for the currently selected
project:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_81.png" /></p>
<p>If the project name does not match the name of the project you want to
configure the data-mapping for, click on the "(Change Project)"
hyperlink to change the current project.</p>
<p>To enable this project for data-synchronization with TFS, you need to
enter:</p>
<p><strong>External Key</strong> -- This should be set to the name of the project in TFS
as visible from the Visual Studio Team Explorer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_82.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Active Flag</strong> -- Set this to 'Yes' so that SpiraTeam knows that you
want to synchronize data for this project. Once the project has been
completed, setting the value to "No" will stop data synchronization,
reducing network utilization.</p>
<p>Click [Update] to confirm these settings. Once you have enabled the
project for data-synchronization, you can now enter the other data
mapping values outlined below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: Once you have successfully configured the project, when
creating a new project, you should choose the option to "Create Project
from Existing Project" rather than "Use Default Template" so that all
the project mappings get copied across to the new project.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-user-mapping">Configuring the User Mapping</h3>
<p>To configure the mapping of users in the two systems, you need to go to
Administration > Users > View Edit Users, which will bring up the list
of users in the system. Then click on the "Edit" button for a particular
user that will be editing work items in TFS:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_83.png" /></p>
<p>You will notice that in the special <strong>Data Mapping</strong> tab, there is a
list of all the configured data-synchronization plug-ins. In the text
box next to the TFS Data-Sync plug-in you need to enter the full name of
this Windows User (not the login). This is the name of the user as they
appear inside work items within TFS:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_84.png" /></p>
<p>This will allow the data-synchronization plug-in to know which user in
SpiraTeam match which equivalent user in TFS. Click [Update] once
you've entered the appropriate login name. You should now repeat for the
other users who will be active in both systems.</p>
<p><em>If you have set the "Auto-Map Users" option in the TFS 2012 plugin, you
can skip this section completely.</em></p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-release-mapping">Configuring the Release Mapping</h3>
<p>When the data-synchronization service runs, when it comes across a
release/iteration in SpiraTeam that it has not seen before, it will
create a corresponding "Iteration" in TFS. Similarly if it comes across
a new Iteration in TFS that it has not seen before, it will create a new
Release/Iteration in SpiraTeam. Therefore when using both systems
together, it is recommended that you only enter new Releases/Iterations
in one system and let the data-synchronization service add them to the
other system.</p>
<p>However you may start out with the situation where you already have
pre-existing Releases/Iterations in both systems that you need to
associate in the data-mapping. If you don't do this, you may find that
duplicates get created when you first enable the data-synchronization
service. Therefore for any Releases/Iterations that already exist in
BOTH systems please navigate to Planning > Releases and click on the
Release/Iteration in question. Make sure you have the 'Overview' tab
visible and expand the "Details" section of the release/iteration:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_85.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to the standard fields and custom properties configured for
Releases, you will see an additional text property called
"<strong>MsTfsDataSync ID</strong>" that is used to store the mapped external
identifier for the equivalent Version in TFS. You need to locate the ID
of the equivalent Iteration in TFS, enter it into this text-box and
click [Save]. You should now repeat for all the other pre-existing
releases.</p>
<p>The TFS Iteration ID is not visible in the TFS user interface, but can
instead be located by opening up the SQL Server that it's installed on,
opening the 'TfsWorkItemTracking' database (in TFS 2010 it
will named after your project collection instead) and locating the
'TreeNodes' table:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_86.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have found the matching Iteration (by name), the numeric value
stored in the ID column (the one on the left) is the value that needs to
get added as the MsTfsDataSync ID inside SpiraTeam.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-standard-incident-field-mapping">Configuring the Standard Incident Field Mapping</h3>
<p>Now that the projects, user and releases have been mapped correctly, we
need to configure the standard incident fields. To do this, go to
Administration > System > Data Synchronization and click on the "View
Project Mappings" for the MsTfsDataSync plug-in entry:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>From this screen, you need to click on Priority, Severity, Status and
Type in turn to configure their values:</p>
<p>a) Incident Type</p>
<p>Click on the "Type" hyperlink under Incident Standard Fields to bring up
the Incident type mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_88.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the incident types available in SpiraTeam and
provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS work item type
name for each one. To make this easier, we recommend that inside the
Administration > Edit Incident Statuses screen you first make all
incident types inactive except <em>Risk, Issue</em> and <em>Bug</em> since only those
types make sense to synchronize with TFS.</p>
<p>b) Incident Status</p>
<p>Click on the "Status" hyperlink under Incident Standard Fields to bring
up the Incident status mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_89.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the incident statuses available in SpiraTeam and
provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS work item
<strong>State + Reason</strong> for each one. Since TFS uses separate
State (Active, Resolved, Closed) and Reason (Fixed, Duplicate, Not
Fixed, etc.) codes and SpiraTeam uses a single status code, you need to
concatenate the TFS State and Reason together with a 'plus' (+) sign so
that the system knows that the incident status in SpiraTeam corresponds
to that specific combination.</p>
<p>You can map multiple SpiraTeam fields to the same TFS fields (e.g. New
and Open in SpiraTeam are both equivalent to 'Active+New' in TFS), in
which case only one of the two values can be listed as Primary = Yes as
that's the value that's used on the reverse synchronization (from TFS >
SpiraTeam).</p>
<p>We recommend that you always point the New and Open statuses inside
SpiraTeam to point to the "Active+New" TFS state+reason, and make Open
in SpiraTeam the Primary status of the two. This is recommended so that
as new incidents in SpiraTeam get synched over to TFS, they will get
switched to the "Active+New" status in TFS which will then be synched
back to "Open" in SpiraTeam. That way you'll be able to see at a glance
which incidents have been synched with TFS and those that haven't.</p>
<p>c) Incident Priority</p>
<p>Click on the "Priority" hyperlink under Incident Standard Fields to
bring up the Incident Priority mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_90.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the incident priorities available in SpiraTeam
and provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS priority
value for each one. To make this easier, we recommend that inside the
Administration > Edit Incident Priorities screen you first make any
statuses not used in TFS inactive in SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>d) Incident Severity (TFS 2012 plugin only)</p>
<p>Click on the "Severity" hyperlink under Incident Standard Fields to
bring up the Incident Severity mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_91.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the incident severities available in SpiraTeam
and provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS severity
value for each one. To make this easier, we recommend that inside the
Administration > Edit Incident Severities screen you first make any
statuses not used in TFS inactive in SpiraTeam.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-incident-custom-property-mapping">Configuring the Incident Custom Property Mapping</h3>
<p>Now that the various SpiraTeam standard incident fields have been mapped
correctly, we need to configure the custom property mappings. This is
used for both custom properties in SpiraTeam that map to custom fields
in TFS and also for custom properties in SpiraTeam that are used to map
to standard fields in TFS (e.g. Area) that don't exist in SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>From the View/Edit Project Data Mapping screen, you need to click on the
name of the Incident Custom Property that you want to add data-mapping
information for:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>a) TFS's Area Field</p>
<p>First you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Lists and create a
new custom list that contains all the different Areas that are being
used in TFS.</p>
<p>Then you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Properties and add
a new <em>list</em> custom property onto the Incident artifact type called
'Area' and link it to the Area custom list you created in the previous
step. This will now be available for mapping.</p>
<p>Now, back in the data-mapping page, click on the 'Area' hyperlink under
Incident Custom Properties to bring up the custom property mapping
configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_92.png" /></p>
<p>First you need to enter the word "Area" as the External Key of the
custom property. This tells the data-sync plug-in that the custom
property in SpiraTeam should be mapped to built-in Area field in TFS.</p>
<p>Next for each of the Property Values in the table (in the lower half of
the page) you need to enter the ID of the various Areas that are
configured in TFS. The TFS Area ID is not visible in the TFS user
interface, but can instead be located by opening up the SQL Server that
it's installed on, opening the 'TfsWorkItemTracking'
database (in TFS 2010 and later it will named after your project
collection instead) and locating the 'TreeNodes' table:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_93.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have found the matching Area (by name), the numeric value
stored in the ID column (the one on the left) is the value that needs to
get added as the External Key inside SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>b) TFS Custom Fields</p>
<p>If the custom field in TFS is a list field, first you need to go to
Administration > Edit Custom Lists in SpiraTeam and create a new custom
list that contains all the different values that are being used in TFS.</p>
<p>Then for both list-fields and value-fields you need to go to
Administration > Edit Custom Properties and add a new custom property
onto the Incident artifact type with the name of the appropriate TFS
field (e.g. Triage, Rank, etc.) and if a list-field, link it to the
custom list you created in the previous step. The custom property will
now be available for data-mapping.</p>
<p>Now, back in the data-synchronization data-mapping page, click on the
hyperlink under Incident Custom Properties that corresponds to the
custom property to bring up the custom property mapping configuration
screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_94.png" /></p>
<p>First you need to enter the full <strong>Reference Name</strong> of the TFS field as
the External Key of the custom property. This tells the data-sync
plug-in that the custom property in SpiraTeam should be mapped to this
specific field in TFS. To see a list of fields and their reference
names, you can run the following SQL query against your TFS database:</p>
<p>SELECT Name, ReferenceName FROM Fields ORDER BY Name</p>
<p>We have included a list of fields in the Agile process template in
<a href="#tfs-field-reference">TFS Field Reference</a> as a helpful reference.</p>
<p>Next for each of the Property Values in the table (in the lower half of
the page) you need to enter the name of the field values as they appear
in TFS as the External Key.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-standard-task-field-mapping">Configuring the Standard Task Field Mapping</h3>
<p>Now that the projects, user, releases and incident fields have been
mapped correctly, we need to configure the standard task fields. To do
this, go to Administration > System > Data Synchronization and click
on the "View Project Mappings" for the MsTfsDataSync plug-in entry:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>From this screen, you need to click on Priority and Status in turn to
configure their values:</p>
<p>a) Task Status</p>
<p>Click on the "Status" hyperlink under Task Standard Fields to bring up
the Task status mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_95.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the task statuses available in SpiraTeam and
provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS work item State
for each one. Unlike the mapping for incidents (see above) SpiraTeam
does not track the reason codes associated with the tasks in MS TFS, so
you only need to map the State names from TFS with the task status
names.</p>
<p>You can map multiple SpiraTeam fields to the same TFS fields (e.g.
Blocked, Completed and Deferred in SpiraTeam are all equivalent to State
= Closed in TFS), in which case only one of the values can be listed as
Primary = Yes as that's the value that's used on the reverse
synchronization (from TFS > SpiraTeam).</p>
<p>b) Task Priority (TFS 2012 Plugin Only)</p>
<p>Click on the "Priority" hyperlink under Task Standard Fields to bring up
the Task Priority mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_96.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the task priorities available in SpiraTeam and
provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS priority value
for each one.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-task-custom-property-mapping">Configuring the Task Custom Property Mapping</h3>
<p>Now that the various SpiraTeam standard task fields have been mapped
correctly, we need to configure the custom property mappings. This is
used for both custom properties in SpiraTeam that map to custom fields
in TFS and also for custom properties in SpiraTeam that are used to map
to standard fields in TFS (e.g. Area) that don't exist in SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>From the View/Edit Project Data Mapping screen, you need to click on the
name of the Task Custom Property that you want to add data-mapping
information for:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>a) TFS's Area Field</p>
<p>First you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Lists and create a
new custom list that contains all the different Areas that are being
used in TFS.</p>
<p>Then you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Properties and add
a new <em>list</em> custom property onto the Task artifact type called 'Area'
and link it to the Area custom list you created in the previous step.
This will now be available for mapping.</p>
<p>Now, back in the data-mapping page, click on the 'Area' hyperlink under
Task Custom Properties to bring up the custom property mapping
configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_97.png" /></p>
<p>First you need to enter the word "Area" as the External Key of the
custom property. This tells the data-sync plug-in that the custom
property in SpiraTeam should be mapped to built-in Area field in TFS.</p>
<p>Next for each of the Property Values in the table (in the lower half of
the page) you need to enter the ID of the various Areas that are
configured in TFS. The TFS Area ID is not visible in the TFS user
interface, but can instead be located by opening up the SQL Server that
it's installed on, opening the 'TfsWorkItemTracking'
database (in TFS 2010 and later it will named after your project
collection instead) and locating the 'TreeNodes' table:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_93.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have found the matching Area (by name), the numeric value
stored in the ID column (the one on the left) is the value that needs to
get added as the External Key inside SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>b) TFS Custom Fields</p>
<p>If the custom field in TFS is a list field, first you need to go to
Administration > Edit Custom Lists in SpiraTeam and create a new custom
list that contains all the different values that are being used in TFS.</p>
<p>Then for both list-fields and value-fields you need to go to
Administration > Edit Custom Properties and add a new custom property
onto the Task artifact type with the name of the appropriate TFS field
(e.g. Discipline, Stack Rank, etc.) and if a list-field, link it to the
custom list you created in the previous step. The custom property will
now be available for data-mapping.</p>
<p>Now, back in the data-synchronization data-mapping page, click on the
hyperlink under Task Custom Properties that corresponds to the custom
property to bring up the custom property mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_98.png" /></p>
<p>First you need to enter the full <strong>Reference Name</strong> of the TFS field as
the External Key of the custom property. This tells the data-sync
plug-in that the custom property in SpiraTeam should be mapped to this
specific field in TFS. To see a list of fields and their reference
names, you can run the following SQL query against your TFS database:</p>
<p>SELECT Name, ReferenceName FROM Fields ORDER BY Name</p>
<p>We have included a list of fields in the Agile process template in
<a href="#tfs-field-reference">TFS Field Reference</a> as a helpful reference.</p>
<p>Next for each of the Property Values in the table (in the lower half of

in TFS as the External Key.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-standard-requirement-field-mapping-2012-plugin-only">Configuring the Standard Requirement Field Mapping (2012 Plugin Only)</h3>
<p>Now that the projects, user, releases, incident and task fields have
been mapped correctly, we need to configure the standard requirement
fields. To do this, go to Administration > System > Data
Synchronization and click on the "View Project Mappings" for the
MsTfsDataSync plug-in entry:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>From this screen, you need to click on Importance and Status in turn to
configure their values:</p>
<p>a) Requirement Status</p>
<p>Click on the "Status" hyperlink under Requirement Standard Fields to
bring up the Requirement status mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_99.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the requirement statuses available in SpiraTeam
and provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS work item
State for each one. Unlike the mapping for incidents (see above)
SpiraTeam does not track the reason codes associated with the
requirements in MS TFS, so you only need to map the State names from TFS
with the requirement status names.</p>
<p>You can map multiple SpiraTeam fields to the same TFS fields, in which
case only one of the values can be listed as Primary = Yes as that's the
value that's used on the reverse synchronization (from TFS >
SpiraTeam).</p>
<p>b) Requirement Importance</p>
<p>Click on the "Importance" hyperlink under Requirement Standard Fields to
bring up the Requirement Importance mapping configuration screen:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_100.png" /></p>
<p>The table lists each of the requirement importance values available in
SpiraTeam and provides you with the ability to enter the matching TFS
work item priority value for each one.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-requirement-custom-property-mapping-2012-plugin-only">Configuring the Requirement Custom Property Mapping (2012 Plugin Only)</h3>
<p>Now that the various SpiraTeam standard requirement fields have been
mapped correctly, we need to configure the custom property mappings.
This is used for both custom properties in SpiraTeam that map to custom
fields in TFS and also for custom properties in SpiraTeam that are used
to map to standard fields in TFS (e.g. Area) that don't exist in
SpiraTeam.</p>
<p>From the View/Edit Project Data Mapping screen, you need to click on the
name of the Requirement Custom Property that you want to add
data-mapping information for:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Using_SpiraTest_with_MS-TFS_87.png" /></p>
<p>a) TFS's Area Field</p>
<p>First you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Lists and create a
new custom list that contains all the different Areas that are being
used in TFS.</p>
<p>Then you need to go to Administration > Edit Custom Properties and add
a new <em>list</em> custom property onto the Requirement artifact type called
'Area' and link it to the Area custom list you created in the previous

<p><strong>Once you have updated the various mapping sections, you are now ready
to start the service.</strong></p>
<h2 id="using-spirateam-with-tfs">Using SpiraTeam with TFS</h2>
<p>Now that the integration service has been configured and the service
started, initially any incidents already created in SpiraTeam for the
specified projects will be imported into TFS and any requirements, tasks
or bugs already created in TFS will be imported into SpiraTeam. At this
point we recommend opening the Windows Event Viewer and choosing the
Application Log. In this log any error messages raised by the SpiraTeam
Data Sync Service will be displayed. If you see any error messages at
this point, we recommend immediately stopping the SpiraTeam service and
checking the various mapping entries. If you cannot see any work items
with the mapping information, we recommend sending a copy of the event
log message(s) to Inflectra customer services (<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#108;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#108;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>)
who will help you troubleshoot the problem.</p>
<p>To use SpiraTeam with TFS on an ongoing basis, we recommend the
following general processes be followed:</p>
<p>When running tests in SpiraTest or SpiraTeam, defects found should be
logged through the Test Execution Wizard as normal.</p>
<p>Once an incident has been created during the running of the test, it
will now be populated across into TFS as a work item of type
corresponding to the types setup in the incident type mappings.</p>
<p>At this point, the incident can be worked on in either system, with
changes being synchronized to the other system. However in general we
recommend that the QA/Testing team use SpiraTeam and the development
team use TFS. E.g. the developers will mark the bugs as resolved in MSTS
once they have completed fixing them and the QA team will either reopen
or close then in SpiraTeam once they have had a change to verify the
resolution.</p>
<p>You are now able to perform test coverage and incident reporting inside
SpiraTest/SpiraTeam using the test cases managed by SpiraTest/SpiraTeam
and the incidents managed collaboratively between SpiraTest/SpiraTeam
and TFS.</p>
<p>You can create project requirements and associated tasks in either
SpiraTeam or TFS, however the synchronization service is only
unidirectional for requirements and tasks, so when you create or update
a requirement or task in TFS, the change will be reflected in SpiraTeam,
but not the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>In most cases once you have started the service, once it's up and
running you will not see any error or warning messages from the
Data-Sync service. However, if you have new users created in SpiraTeam
that have not been mapped to users in TFS, when you assign incidents,
requirements or tasks to those items, you may see warning messages in
the Event Viewer letting you know which users needs to be mapped.</p>
