1. In the tools directory, paste the .docx files you would like to convert
2. In powershell, `cd` to tools and run `.\convdocx.cmd "filename"` where filename is the name of a _single_ docx (ex. `.\convdocx.cmd "SpiraTestPlanTeam IDE Integration Guide.docx"`)
3. Create a directory called "temp" at the root of the project
4. Copy the `.md` file generated by `convdocx` into the root of temp
5. Copy the generated folder (ex. `SpiraTestPlanTeam_IDE_Integration_Guide`) into the root of temp
6. Run `python .\postprocess.py "folder"` where folder is the one you just copied over (ex. `python .\postprocess.py "SpiraTestPlanTeam_IDE_Integration_Guide"`)
7. Run `python .\imagefix.py "folder"` where folder is the same as in step 6 (ex. `python .\imagefix.py "SpiraTestPlanTeam_IDE_Integration_Guide"`)
8. Now you can safely delete the .md file in the root of temp, in tools, and any images in a folder called "media"
