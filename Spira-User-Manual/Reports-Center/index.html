<h1 id="reports-center">Reports Center</h1>
<p>This section describes the reporting features of SpiraPlan®, including
an overview of each of the report types that are available. When you
click on the "Reports" tab on the global navigation bar, you will
initially be taken to the reports home page illustrated below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_335.png" /></p>
<p>This page consists of three main areas:</p>
<p>The top left-hand pane displays a list of any reports that have either
been saved by the currently logged in user, or those reports created by
other members of the product, that have been marked (by that user) as
'shareable'.</p>
<p>The bottom left-hand main pane displays a list of the printable reports
available in the system, categorized by the artifact they primarily
relate to (requirements, test cases, incidents and releases). Clicking
on any of the report hyperlinks will take you to the <a href="#reports-configuration">configuration page</a>
for the report in question below for details).</p>
<p>The right-hand pane is a dashboard that contains the set of graph
widgets configured by the current user. By default the dashboard will
display: the Incident Progress Rate, Test Run Progress Rate, Requirement
Summary, Test Case Summary, Incident Aging and Task Burndown.</p>
<p>In addition to the graphs displayed by default, you can click on the
"<strong><em>Add Items</em></strong>" buttons to add additional graphs to the
reporting dashboard:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_336.png" /></p>
<p>Each of the graphs is described in more detail in <a href="#summary-graphs">Summary Graphs</a> to <a href="#date-range-graphs">Date-Range Graphs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reports-configuration">Reports Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration page for each report differs slightly, but the general
format is illustrated below (please note all sections are shown in
orange text with a line beneath and are shown here in the collapsed
state -- click the orange text to expand the section):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_337.png" /></p>
<p>You can configure the reports in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Report Format</strong> -- This allows you to specify the display format of
the report. Depending on the specific report, they can be displayed as a
web-page (HTML), downloaded as a Microsoft Word document, downloaded as
a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or downloaded as a Microsoft Product file.
In addition there is a raw-XML format that allows you to export the
underlying report data into any external reporting system that supports
XML import.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_338.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Report Elements</strong> -- This allows you to determine which types of
information to include in the report. This varies by report type, but
includes the dependent items related to the artifact being reported on
(attachments, test steps, coverage, history, etc.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_339.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Standard Field Filters</strong> -- This allows you to constrain the range of
data being reported on, based on the various fields associated with the
artifact in question. These filters are typically selections from
multi-valued-dropdown lists and date-ranges.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_340.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Custom Property Filters</strong> -- This allows you to constrain the range of
data being reported on, based on the custom fields associated with the
artifact by your product administrator. These filters can be either
freetext or drop-down lists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_341.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Sort Options</strong> - This option is only available for the
non-hierarchical data reports (i.e. for test cases, test sets, test
runs, incidents and tasks) and allows you to specify the sort order of
the results returned in the report. For the hierarchical-data based
reports the sort order is always the order of the hierarchy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_342.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Report Name</strong> -- If you would like to save the report configuration so
that you can quickly re-run it at a later date, you just need to enter a
name for the report and indicate (by selecting the checkbox or not)
whether you want this report to be private or shared by all members of
the product.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_343.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have selected the format, elements and filters, clicking the
"<strong><em>Create Report</em></strong>" button launches the report in a new
window. Each of the reports is described in <a href="#requirement-reports">Requirement Reports</a> to <a href="#release-reports">Release Reports</a> below:</p>

for this chart.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_386.png" /></p>
<p>In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of
incidents, and the x-axis represents a specific week in the time-span.
The exact count of each bar in the stacked histogram can be viewed by
positioning the mouse pointer over the bar, and a "tooltip" will pop-up
listing the actual data value. You can also filter the type of incident
being reported, as well as change the date interval. If you choose a
smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if
you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly.</p>
<p>Clicking on the "<strong><em>Display Data Grid</em></strong>" button will
display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In
addition, clicking on the "<strong><em>Download Data as CSV</em></strong>"
button will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format
that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability
to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).</p>
<h2 id="custom-graphs">Custom Graphs</h2>
<p>These are the graphs that a SpiraPlan administrator has created in the
Administration section of the system and published for use by end users.
They rely on specific ESQL data queries, so the data represented will
depend on the query created by the administrator.</p>
<p>To add a custom graph to your reports dashboard, click on the <strong>Add
Items</strong> icon and choose Custom Graphs:</p>

<p>Once you add the Custom Graphs widget to your dashboard, you will see
the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_388.png" /></p>
<p>You can change which custom graph will be used in this widget by simply
changing the values in the dropdown list:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_389.png" /></p>
<p>You can also change the graph display between the three display types:
donut, bar, and line. The donut style of graph is only available for
reports with a single data series:</p>

<p>Clicking on the "<strong><em>Data Grid</em></strong>" icon will display the
underlying data that is being used to generate the graph.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Reports_Center_391.png" /></p>
<p>In addition, clicking on the "<strong><em>Download Data as CSV</em></strong>"
button will export the data grid into Comma Separated Values (CSV)
format that can be opened in MS-Excel.</p>
<p>Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image
file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).</p>
