<h1 id="incident-tracking">Incident Tracking</h1>
<p>This section outlines how the incident/defect tracking features of
SpiraPlan® can be used to manage key product artifacts during the
software development lifecycle. In addition to managing the defects
raised during the execution of test cases in the test management module,
the Incident Tracker is also a powerful risk/issue/bug tracking system
in its own right. When coupled with the <a href="../User-Product-Management/#product-home">product dashboard</a> it is a powerful tool for representing all the key risks and issues
associated with a product in a single, graphical format.</p>
<p>Unlike a standalone bug/issue tracking tool however, you can trace the
incidents/defects back to the test case and the underlying requirement
that generated them, giving the product manager unprecedented power in
analyzing the "in-process" quality of a system during its lifecycle.
This power is clearly illustrated in the "Requirement Incident Count"
pane in the Product Home dashboard (see <a href="../User-Product-Management/#requirements-coverage">User/Product Management &gt; Requirements Coverage</a>).</p>
<h2 id="incident-list">Incident List</h2>
<p>When you click on the Tracking > Incidents global navigation link, you
will initially be taken to the incidents list screen illustrated below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_238.png" /></p>
<p>The incident list screen displays all the incidents entered for the
current product, in a filterable, sortable grid. The grid displays the
incident number together with fields such as incident type (bug, issue,
risk, etc.), status (new, open, etc.), priority, name, assigned owner,
detection date, detector, closed date, etc. The choice of columns
displayed is configurable per-user, per-product, giving extensive
flexibility when it comes to viewing and searching incidents.</p>
<p>The sidebar on the left gives you quick access to saved filters, along
with some useful charts to get an at-a-glance view of incidents for this
product.</p>
<p>In addition, you can view a more detailed description of the incident
(along with a resolution if any) by positioning the mouse pointer over
the incident name hyperlink and waiting for the popup "tooltip" to
appear. If you click on the incident name hyperlink, you will be taken
to the incident details page described in <a href="../Incident-Tracking/#incident-details">Incident Tracking &gt; Incident Details</a>. Clicking on any
of the pagination links at the bottom of the page will advance you to
the next set of incidents in the list according to the applied filter
and sort-order. There is also a drop-down-list at the bottom of the page
which allows you to specify how many rows should be displayed in each
page, helping accommodate different user preferences.</p>
<h3 id="sorting-and-filtering">Sorting and Filtering</h3>
<p>You can easily filter and sort the list of incidents as illustrated in
the screen-shot below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_239.png" /></p>
<p>To filter the list by incident type, status, priority, owner or detector
name, you simply choose an item from the appropriate drop-down list, and
for the other fields, you enter a free-text phrase then click
"<strong><em>Filter</em></strong>" or press the &lt;ENTER> key to apply the
different filters. Note that the name field is searched using a "LIKE"
comparison, so that searching for "database" would include any item with
the word database in the name. The other freetext fields need to be
exact matches (e.g. dates, incident numbers). There are also several
aggregate filters that are used to filter on multiple values at once
(e.g. filtering status on (All Open) will return any incident that is in
one of the open statuses -- new, open, assigned, reopen).</p>
<p>To change the column that is sorted, or to change the direction of the
current sort, simply click on the up/down arrow icon in the appropriate
column. The currently sorted column is indicated by the darker arrow. In
the screen-shot above, we are filtering on type=bug and sorting by
decreasing priority.</p>
<p>Clicking on Filter > Clear Filter removes any set filters and expands
the incident list to display all incidents for the current product, and
clicking on Filter > Save Filter allows you to save the filter to your
'My Page' for use in the future. The list of saved filters can also be
retrieved by clicking Filter > Retrieve Filter.</p>
<p>As a shortcut, the left hand panel includes a set of <strong>Quick Filters</strong>
that can be applied in a single-click:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The topmost section displays any saved incident filters created by
the current user or that are shared with the current user (the
former are designated with an icon representing a single person, the
latter a group of people)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Components</strong> -- This section lists the components defined for the
current product. Clicking on any of the components in the list will
filter the incidents to only show those that are associated with the
selected component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Releases</strong> -- This section lists the releases and sprints defined
for the current product. Clicking on any of the releases or sprints
in the list will filter the incident by that <strong>resolved
release/sprint</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-incident">New Incident</h3>
<p>Clicking on the "<strong><em>New Incident</em></strong>" button takes you to
the new incident screen. This is essentially the same screen as the
incident details screen shown in <a href="../Incident-Tracking/#incident-details">Incident Details</a> except, depending on how
the workflow has been configured for your product, certain fields may be
disabled. For more details on setting and up configuring workflow for
your product, please refer to the <em>SpiraTest Administration Guide</em>.</p>
<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>Clicking on the "<strong><em>Delete</em></strong>" button deletes the
incidents whose check-boxes have been selected in the incident list.</p>
<h3 id="refresh">Refresh</h3>
<p>Clicking on the "<strong><em>Refresh</em></strong>" button simply reloads the
list of incidents; this is useful when new incidents are being added by
other users, and you want to make sure you have the most up-to-date list
displayed.</p>
<h3 id="show-hide-columns">Show / Hide Columns</h3>
<p>This drop-down list allows you to change the fields that are displayed
in the incident list as columns for the current product. To show a
column that is not already displayed, simply select that column from the
list of "Show..." column names and to hide an existing column, simply
select that column from the list of "Hide..." column names. This is
stored on a per-product basis, so you can have different display
settings for each product that you are a member of. The fields can be
any of the built-in fields or any of the custom properties set up by the
product owner.</p>
<h3 id="edit">Edit</h3>
<p>Each incident in the list has an "<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>" button
display in its right-most column. When you click this button or just
<em>double-click</em> on any of the cells in the row, you change the item from
"View" mode to "Edit" mode. The various columns are made editable, and
"<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" buttons are
displayed in the last column:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_240.png" /></p>
<p>If you click "<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>" on more than one row, the
"<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" buttons are
only displayed on the first row, and you can make changes to all the
editable rows and then update the changes by clicking the one
"<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" button. Also, if you want to make the same
change to multiple rows (e.g. to change five incidents from "Resolved"
status to "Closed"), you can click on the "fill" icon to the right of
the editable item, which will propagate the new value to all editable
items in the same column.</p>
<p>If you want to edit lots of items, first select their checkboxes and
then click the "<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>" button on the same row as the
Filters and it will switch all the selected items into edit mode.</p>
<p>When you have made your updates, you can either click
"<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" to commit the changes, or
"<strong><em>Cancel</em></strong>" to revert back to the original information.
Alternatively, pressing the &lt;ENTER> key will commit the changes and
pressing the &lt;ESCAPE> key will cancel the changes.</p>
<h3 id="cloning-incidents">Cloning Incidents</h3>
<p>To create a clone of an existing incident or set of incidents, simply
select the check-boxes of the incidents you want to copy and then click
"<strong><em>Clone</em></strong>". This will make a copy of the current
incident with its name prefixed 'Copy of ....' to distinguish itself
from the original. Any file attachments will also be copied along with
the incident itself.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-incidents">Exporting Incidents</h3>
<p>To export an incident or set of incidents from the current product to
another product in the system, select the check-boxes of the incident(s)
you want to export and then click the Tools > "<strong><em>Export to
Product</em></strong>". This will then bring up a list of possible
destination products:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_241.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have chosen the destination product and clicked the
"<strong><em>Export</em></strong>" button, the incidents will be exported from
the current product to the destination product. Any file attachments
will also be copied to the destination product along with the
incidents.</p>
<h3 id="creating-requirement-from-incidents">Creating Requirement from Incidents</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may have a situation where an enhancement has been logged
in the incident tracker and now that it has been approved, it needs to
be converted into a formal requirement so that test cases and tasks can
be generated from it. To aid this process, there is a shortcut that
allows you to create new requirement from selected incidents and have it
be automatically added to the requirements list. When that is performed
an association is automatically added that links this new requirement to
the original incident.</p>
<p>To activate this feature, select the checkboxes of the incidents you
want to convert and then click Tools > Convert Into Requirements.</p>
<h3 id="printing-items">Printing Items</h3>
<p>To quickly print a single incident or list of incidents you can select
the items' checkboxes and then click Tools > Print Items. This will
display a popup window containing a printable version of the selected
items. You can also save the report in a variety of common formats from
the same Tools menu.</p>
<h2 id="incident-details">Incident Details</h2>
<p>When you click on an incident item in the incident list, or click the
"<strong><em>New Incident</em></strong>" button (as described in <a href="#incident-list">Incident List</a>),
you are taken to the incident details page illustrated below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_242.png" /></p>
<p>This page is made up of three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the left pane is the navigation window where you can quickly jump to
other incidents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the upper part of the right pane contains the incident name and key
information about it (it's ID number, and what type of incident it
is), as well as the current status (see below); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bottom part of the right pane displays different information
associated with the incident across a number of tabs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The navigation pane consists of a link that will take you back to the
incidents list, as well as a list of the peer incidents to the one
selected. This latter list is useful as a navigation shortcut; you can
quickly view the peer incidents by clicking on the navigation links
without having to first return to the incidents list page. The
navigation list can be switched between four different modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list of incidents matching the current filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of all incidents, irrespective of the current filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of incidents assigned to the current user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of incidents detected/found by the current user</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the left hand navigation, you can enter a specific
incident number in the text-box in the toolbar and click the
"<strong><em>Find</em></strong>" button. In the same toolbar, there is also a
shortcut for creating a copy of the current by clicking the
"<strong><em>Clone</em></strong>" button.</p>
<h3 id="editing-an-existing-incident">Editing an Existing Incident</h3>
<p>If you are editing an existing incident, the fields that are available
and the fields that are required will depend on your stage in the
incident workflow. For example an open incident might not require a
"Resolved Version" whereas a resolved incident may well. The types of
change allowed and the email notifications that are sent will depend on
how your product administrator has setup the system for you.
Administrators should refer to the <em>SpiraPlan Administration Guide</em> for
details on configuring the incident workflows to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Depending on the user's role and whether they are listed as the owner or
detector of the incident or not, the dropdown next to the incident's
current status shows the allowed workflow operations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_243.png" /></p>
<p>These workflow transitions allow the user to move the incident from one
status to another. For example when the incident is in the Assigned
status, you will be given the options to:</p>
<p><strong>Resolve the Incident</strong> -- changes status to "Resolved"</p>
<p><strong>Unable to Reproduce</strong> -- changes the status to "Not Reproducible"</p>
<p><strong>Duplicate Incident</strong> - changes the status to "Duplicate"</p>
<p>After changing the status of the incident by clicking on the link, you
can then fill in the additional fields that are now enabled and/or
required. Once you've made the changes to the appropriate incident
fields, you can click "<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" or one of the options
from the "<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" dropdown list to commit the changes
or "<strong><em>Refresh</em></strong>" to discard the changes and reload the
incident from the database.</p>
<p>Please note that if digital signatures have been enabled for a
particular workflow operation (and therefore a digital signature is
required to confirm the status change. Workflow operations requiring a
digital signature are marked with a padlock icon as in the example
below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_244.png" /></p>
<p>On attempting to save changes made after clicking a workflow operation
that requires a digital signature you will be presented with a popup
similar to the one below (which is for a requirement):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_138.png" /></p>
<p>You can print the current incident by clicking Tools > Print, which
will display a printable version of the page in a separate window.
Alternatively, you can export the incident to a number of formats by
selecting the appropriate option from the Tools menu.</p>
<h3 id="inserting-a-new-incident">Inserting a New Incident</h3>
<p>If you are creating a new incident, the fields that are available and
the fields that are required will depend on how your product has been
for configured. For example, some products may require that all
incidents be started with Status=New and Type=Incident, others may allow
you to specify the incident type. The types of change allowed will
depend on how your product administrator has setup the system for you.
Administrators should refer to the <em>SpiraPlan Administration Guide</em> for
details on configuring the incident workflows to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Once you've filled out the appropriate incident fields, you can either
click "<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" or one of the options from the
"<strong><em>Save</em></strong>" dropdown list to commit the changes or click
on "<strong><em>Back to Incident List</em></strong>" to discard the insertion
and return back to the incident list.</p>
<h3 id="overview-comments">Overview - Comments</h3>
<p>The Comments section allows users to add and view discussions related to
the incident:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_245.png" /></p>
<p>Existing comments are displayed by date (either newest-first or
oldest-first) above the text box. To add a comment to the incident,
enter your text into the textbox, then click the "<strong><em>Add
Comment</em></strong>" button to save.</p>
<h3 id="overview-dates-and-times">Overview -- Dates and Times</h3>
<p>This section displays the general schedule and completion status of the
specific incident. You can enter/edit the start-date, closed-date (i.e.
the due-date), estimate, actual and remaining effort. From these values,
the system will display the calculated percent completion, progress
indicator and producted final effort. Any custom date fields set up by
the system administrator or product owner will also appear in this
section (as shown below with the Review Date field).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_246.png" /></p>
<h3 id="attachments">Attachments</h3>
<p>In this tab, the lower section of the screen displays the list of
documents, screenshots or web links (URLs) that have been "attached" to
the incident. The documents can be in any format, though SpiraPlan® will
only display the icon for certain known types.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_247.png" /></p>
<p>The attachment list includes the filename that was originally uploaded
together with the file-size (in KB), name of the person who attached it
and the date uploaded. In addition, if you position the pointer over the
filename and hold it there for a few seconds, a detailed description is
displayed as a tooltip.</p>
<p>To actually view the document, simply click on the filename hyperlink
and a new web browser window will open. Depending on the type of file,
this window will either display the document or prompt you for a place
to save it on your local computer. To delete an existing attachment from
an incident, click the "<strong><em>Remove</em></strong>" button and the
attachment will be removed from the list.</p>
<p>To attach a new document to the incident, you need to first click the
"<strong><em>Add New</em></strong>" link to display the new attachment dialog
box:</p>
<p><img alt="g4169" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_114.png" /></p>
<p>There are three different types of item that can be attached to an
incident:</p>
<p>To upload a file, choose "File" as the type and then click the Browse
button and select the file from your local computer, optionally enter a
detailed description then click the "<strong><em>Upload</em></strong>" button.
The document will be copied from your computer and attached to the
artifact.</p>
<p>To attach a web-link (URL) to the artifact, you need to choose "URL" as
the type and then enter the fully qualified URL (e.g.
<a href="http://mywebsite.com/?Document=1">http://mywebsite.com?Document=1</a>), an
optional description and then click the "<strong><em>Upload</em></strong>"
button to attach the web-link.</p>
<p>To attach a screenshot to the artifact, you need to choose "Screenshot"
as the type and then copy the image to your computer's clipboard (e.g.
on Windows computers, the PRINT SCREEN button captures the current page
and adds to the clipboard). Once the image is in the clipboard, paste it
into the editor using CTRL+V (or the equivalent keystroke for your
operating system) and the item will appear in the preview window. You
can then fill in the other fields and click "<strong><em>Upload</em></strong>"
to attach the image.</p>
<p>Note: If you are using a non-Windows® computer (e.g. Macintosh®) that
doesn't put file extensions on filenames (e.g. .xls for an Excel sheet)
automatically, then you will need to manually add the file extension to
the filename before uploading if you want it to be displayed with the
correct icon in the attachment list.</p>
<p>You can also associate an existing document (that's already stored in
SpiraTeam) with the incident. To do that, click on the "<strong><em>Add
Existing</em></strong>" button to bring up the add file association
dialog box:</p>
<p><img alt="g4197" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_156.png" /></p>
<p>You can then choose to either associate a document stored in the
SpiraPlan Documents repository or (in the case of SpiraPlan/SpiraTeam
but not SpiraTest) from the linked source code repository. In either
case you first select the appropriate folder, and then pick the
document(s) from the file list on the right. In the case of a source
code file association you can also add a comment.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>This tab displays the list of changes that have been performed on the
incident artifact since its creation. An example incident change history
is depicted below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_248.png" /></p>
<p>The change history displays the date that each change was made, together
with the fields that were changed, the old and new values and the person
who made the change. This allows a complete audit trail to be maintained
of all changes in the system.</p>
<h3 id="associations">Associations</h3>
<p>This tab displays a list of any requirements, tasks, test runs, test
steps or other incidents that are associated with this incident:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_249.png" /></p>
<p>The incidents and tasks in this list are ones that a user has decided
are relevant to the current one and has created a direct link between
them. In the case of requirements and test cases, the association can be
either due to the creator of an incident directly linking the incident
to the requirement or test step, or it can be the result of a tester
executing a test-run and creating an incident during the test run. In
this latter case, the check-box to the left of the association will be
unavailable as the link is not editable.</p>
<p>Each association is displayed with the type of association (related-to,
vs. a dependency), name of the artifact being linked-to, type of
artifact (requirement, incident, etc.), the name of the person who
created the association, a comment that describes why the association
was made, and the product of the linked artifact. In the case of an
indirect association due to a test run, the comment will contain the
name of the test run.</p>
<p>You can perform the following actions on an association from this
screen:</p>
<p><strong>Delete</strong> -- removes the selected association to the other artifact.
This will only delete the association, not the linked artifact itself.</p>
<p><strong>Refresh</strong> -- updates the list of associations from the server, useful
if other people are adding associations to this incident at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>Filter / Apply Filter</strong> -- Applies the entries in the filter boxes to
the list of associations</p>
<p><strong>Clear Filter</strong> -- Clears the current filter, so that all associations
for the current incident are shown.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> -- Clicking the "<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>" button to the right
of the associations allows you to edit the association type and comment
fields inline directly on this screen.</p>
<p>To create a new association, click the "<strong><em>Add</em></strong>" button
to display the "Add New Association" panel:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_250.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have selected the appropriate artifact type, you will then be
able to browse or search for the specific artifact you want to link to.
You can also enter the ID of the artifact directly (if known). In either
case you can also add a comment that explains the rationale for the
association. If you're adding an association to a test step, the test
steps are grouped in their test cases. You can browse the list of test
cases within each test case folder.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_251.png" /></p>
<h3 id="creating-a-requirement-from-an-incident">Creating a Requirement from an Incident</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may have a situation where an enhancement has been logged
in the incident tracker and now that it has been approved, it needs to
be converted into a formal requirement so that test cases and tasks can
be generated from it. To aid this process, there is a button on the
Associations tab that allows you to create a new requirement from the
current incident and have it be automatically added to the requirements
list. When that is performed an association is automatically added that
links this new requirement to the original incident.</p>
<h3 id="emailing-the-incident">Emailing the Incident</h3>
<p>Using the "<strong><em>Email</em></strong>" button on the toolbar, you can
send an email containing details of the incident to an email address or
another user on the system:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_217.png" /></p>
<p>You can specify the subject line for the email, and either a list of
email addresses, separated by semicolons, or an existing product user.
The content of the email is specified in the System Administration --
Notification Templates.</p>
<p>To be notified of any changes made to the current artifact via email,
click the "<strong><em>Subscribe</em></strong>" button. If you already
subscribed, the button will instead let you
"<strong><em>Unsubscribe</em></strong>" to stop receiving emails about that
particular artifact.</p>
<h3 id="incident-followers">Incident Followers</h3>
<p>Using the "<strong><em>Subscribe</em></strong>" button on the toolbar, you can
quickly follow the incident, and receive updates on certain changes to
it. Depending on your role, you may also see a dropdown to this button,
which let's you add another product member as a follower to this
incident.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_99.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_100.png" /></p>
<p>You can also quickly see who is following an incident under the "People"
section in the Overview tab.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_101.png" /></p>
<p>To view information about the follower, or to unfollow them from the
incident, hover over their avatar to display a user profile card.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_102.png" /></p>
<h2 id="incident-board">Incident Board</h2>
<p>The incident board is an alternative to the <a href="#incident-list">incident list</a> page designed to let you view the incidents
planned for the current product. You can access this feature by clicking
on the <strong>Board</strong> icon in the top-right of the Incidents list page. You
can switch back to the Incident list page by clicking on the <strong>Table</strong>
view.</p>
<p>The incident board has the following different display modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All Releases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Sprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Person</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these views is described below:</p>
<h3 id="incidents-by-priority">Incidents -- By Priority</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the list of planned incidents
organized by priority. Each of the possible priority values is displayed
on the left-hand side and the incidents displayed in the same row on the
right:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_252.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of incidents that are not assigned
a priority, with the other sections containing the incidents that have
been assigned to the specific priority.</p>
<h3 id="incidents-by-status">Incidents -- By Status</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the incidents in the current
product / release / sprint organized by their status. Each incident
status (not started, in progress, completed, blocked, deferred) is
displayed as a heading, with the incidents displayed in the same column
underneath:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_253.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on the expand/collapse icons to hide any resources that
are not relevant.</p>
<p>Depending on the view (all releases, release, or sprint), there may be
sections with the release and sprint name. You can drag and drop the
incidents between statuses or to/from the release/sprint backlog. Any
incidents not assigned to a release/sprint will be listed in the
(Unassigned Items) section at the top.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_254.png" /></p>
<h3 id="incidents-by-person">Incidents - By Person</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the incidents in the current
product / release / sprint organized by resource / person. Each of the
users that is a member of the current product is displayed as a heading,
with the incidents displayed in the same column underneath:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_255.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on the expand/collapse icons to hide any resources that
are not relevant. The system will display a progress bar for each
resource to illustrate the allocation for that resource. Any resource
that has a progress bar that is completely green has been fully
scheduled and should not have any additional incidents assigned. If the
progress bar for that resource turns red, it means that they have been
over-scheduled and you need to reassign some of the incidents.</p>
<p>Depending on the view (all releases, release, or sprint), there may be
sections with the release and sprint name; they contain incidents that
are scheduled for the current release or sprint but have not yet been
assigned to a resource. You can drag and drop the incidents between
resources or to/from the release/sprint backlog. Any incidents not
assigned to a resource and release/sprint will be listed in the
(Unassigned Items) section at the top.</p>
<h3 id="incidents-by-release">Incidents - By Release</h3>
<p>This view is only available when you are displaying the incident board
for 'all releases'. Each of the active releases defined for the current
product is displayed as a heading, with the incidents displayed in the
same column underneath</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_256.png" /></p>
<p>You can drag and drop the incidents between the different releases. Once
the incident has been added to the release, the utilized effort for the
release will increase, and the available effort will decrease by the
same amount.</p>
<p>Note: The system will allow you to assign more incidents to a release
than it is possible to complete, however this will result in a negative
value for 'available effort'. If this happens, the "Available Effort"
value will be displayed in red, and you need to rebalance the items,
extend the release length or add product personnel resources to the
release.</p>
<p>Clicking on the release hyperlinks in the headers will switch the
incident board into the release view.</p>
<h3 id="incidents-by-sprint">Incidents - By Sprint</h3>
<p>This view is only available when you are displaying the incident board
for a specific release. Each of the sprints defined for the current
release is displayed as a heading, with the incidents displayed in the
same column underneath. This view is commonly used in <strong>Scrum</strong>
products:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Incident_Tracking_257.png" /></p>
<p>You can drag and drop the incidents between the different sprints. Once
the incident has been added to the sprint, the utilized effort for the
sprint will increase, and the available effort will decrease by the same
amount.</p>
<p>Note: The system will allow you to assign more incidents to a sprint
than it is possible to complete, however this will result in a negative
value for 'available effort'. If this happens, the "Available Effort"
value will be displayed in red, and you need to rebalance the items,
extend the sprint length or add product personnel resources to the
sprint.</p>
<p>Clicking on the sprint hyperlinks in the headers will switch the
incident board into the sprint view.</p></div>
