<h1 id="planning-board">Planning Board</h1>
<p>The SpiraPlan planning board is a great way to visualize the backlog
items (requirements, tasks, test cases and incidents) planned for your
product. Based on the principles of <strong>agile methodologies</strong> such as
Scrum and Kanban, the planning board is a great tool for planning agile
products.</p>
<p>To access the SpiraPlan <strong>product</strong> planning board, select a product and
go to Artifacts > Planning Board and the following screen will be
displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_406.png" /></p>
<p>To access the SpiraTest <strong>program</strong> planning board, select a program and
go to the Planning menu and the following screen will be displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_407.png" /></p>
<p>We shall first discuss the product planning board, and then we will cover the program planning board.</p>
<p>By default, the system will display the product planning board in the
product backlog view, with the backlog organized by component. You can
change the view by click on the '<strong>Planning'</strong> drop down list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Product Backlog</strong> -- This displays a list of all the backlog items
that are not currently scheduled for a specific release or sprint.
The items can be organized by component, package, priority or
person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All Releases</strong> -- This displays a list of all the releases as well
as the product backlog and is designed to let you easily move items
from the product backlog to a specific release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Release View</strong> -- This displays a list of all the backlog items
that are scheduled for the selected release and lets you organize
them by sprint, status, or person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sprint View</strong> - This displays a list of all the backlog items that
are scheduled for the selected sprint (also known as a Sprint in
some methodologies) and lets you organize them by status, or person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The '<strong>Group By'</strong> dropdown list is used to change how the view is
organized. This list of options available in the 'Group By' dropdown
will depend on the view being displayed.</p>
<p>The planning board will include the following backlog items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Requirements and Incidents</strong> -- these are displayed as 'story
cards' and are the primary items that can be moved in the planning
board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tasks and Test Cases</strong> -- these are secondary artifacts and are
considered part of a requirement. So within the planning board they
are displayed as being part of a specific requirement, and if you
move a requirement, the associated tasks and test cases will move as
well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The backlog items themselves can be configured to display in different
ways. The choice of display will depend on how many backlog items you
have to display, how large your screen is and what information you need.
The display is controlled by the four checkboxes at the top of the
planning board:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard View</strong> -- This is the view that will be displayed when
'detailed view' is unchecked. It displays the minimum necessary
information in each story card, but maximizes how many story cards
can be displayed on the screen. Each story card will contain the
icon, ID, name, user avatar, and estimate (in story points) of the
requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_408.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed View</strong> -- This view includes additional information in
each story card. It adds the long description, a progress bar
indicator (that indicates what percentage of the item has been
completed) and for requirement artifacts it includes the number of
tasks (red background) and number of test cases (yellow background)
in the two small boxes under the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numerical rankings are also shown. The ranking numbers go from left to right and top to bottom. They indicate the relative ordering and priority of the various story cards and defects.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_409.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incidents</strong> -- The planning board will always include requirement
backlog items, but because the number of incidents can be very
large, there is the option to include/exclude them from the planning
board. When you have the "Incidents" checkbox selected, incidents
will appear in the planning board with their own story card format.
The main difference is that the effort is recorded in hours rather
than story points:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_410.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tasks</strong> -- When the Tasks option is selected, the planning board
will display the tasks associated with the requirements as part of
each story card. Each task will be displayed with its ID and a
miniature progress bar:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_411.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test Cases</strong> -- When the Test Cases option is selected, the
planning board will display the test cases associated with the
requirements as part of each story card. Each test case will be
displayed with its ID and a miniature test coverage bar-chart:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_412.png" /></p>
<p>Regardless of the view, backlog items can be moved using "drag and drop"
between the different parts of the planning board. To drag and drop
multiple items, you should first select the items so that they are
highlighted. Then you can drag and drop the entire selection:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_413.png" /></p>
<p>You can add new requirement backlog items by clicking the
"<strong><em>+</em></strong>" button. This will display the following dialog
box:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_414.png" /></p>
<p>On this screen you can enter the fields for a new requirement, click
"<strong><em>Add Requirement</em></strong>" and the requirement will be added
to the appropriate section of the planning board.</p>
<p>In some of the views of the planning board there will be more data that
can be displayed on one screen, in which case you will be able to scroll
the planning board left and right using the specially provided arrow
buttons.</p>
<p>Each of the views is now described in more detail in the sections below.</p>
<h2 id="product-backlog-planning">Product Backlog Planning</h2>
<p>The product backlog view is designed to let you view the backlog items
that have been created for the product and have not yet been assigned to
a specific release or sprint. The backlog items can be requirements or
incidents, and in the case of requirements, you can see the tasks and
test cases associated with a specific requirement.</p>
<p>In this view you can drag and drop the backlog items from one section
(e.g. component) to another and also rearrange the backlog items in
their relative order. By default, the items are sorted according to
their priority/importance value (the color of which is indicated in the
left-hand side of the story card), but you can drag and drop them into a
different order. This is particularly useful when you have several items
of the same priority and you need to rank them. This process is
typically called <strong>backlog grooming</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="product-backlog-by-component">Product Backlog -- By Component</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product backlog organized by
Component. Each of the components is displayed on the left-hand side and
the backlog items displayed in the same row on the right. The backlog
items can be requirements (with associated tasks and test cases) or
incidents.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_415.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of items that are not assigned to
a component, with the other sections containing the items that belong to
the specific component.</p>
<h3 id="product-backlog-by-package">Product Backlog -- By Package</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product backlog organized by
requirement package (a summary requirement). Each of the packages is
displayed on the left-hand side in a hierarchical structure, and the
backlog items displayed in the same row on the right. The backlog items
can be child requirements (with associated tasks and test cases) or
incidents. In this view the incidents are the ones linked to the package
through an association.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_416.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of items that are not assigned to
a package, with the other sections containing the items that are
children of the specific package.</p>
<h3 id="product-backlog-by-priority">Product Backlog -- By Priority</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product backlog organized by
requirement importance. Each of the possible importance values is
displayed on the left-hand side and the backlog items displayed in the
same row on the right. The backlog items in this view will only be
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_417.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of items that are not assigned a
priority, with the other sections containing the items that have been
assigned to the specific priority.</p>
<h3 id="product-backlog-by-status">Product Backlog -- By Status</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product backlog organized by
requirement status. Each of the possible status values (for an
unscheduled item) is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items
displayed in the same column underneath. The backlog items in this view
will only be requirements (with associated tasks and test cases). This
view is commonly called a <strong>Kanban</strong> board:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_418.png" /></p>
<p>Each of the vertical sections is one of the requirements' statuses, in
order of the requirement lifecycle (Requested > Accepted). Once a
requirement is assigned to a release or sprint it will come
automatically 'Planned' and not appear in this view. You can drag and
drop the requirements between the different statuses.</p>
<h2 id="release-planning">Release Planning</h2>
<p>The 'All Releases' option lets you view all of the backlog items that
have already been assigned to a release - and are therefore not in the
product backlog. The backlog items can be requirements or incidents, and
in the case of requirements, you can see the tasks and test cases
associated with a specific requirement.</p>
<p>The lower section of the board allows you to view the items by either by
release, priority, status, or person. Each section below will discuss
each option in turn.</p>
<h3 id="release-planning-by-release">Release Planning -- By Release</h3>
<p>This release planning view is designed to let you view the backlog items
that have been created for the product and associate them with different
releases defined for the product</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_419.png" /></p>
<p>The 'Unassigned Items' section at the top allows you to see all the
items not currently planned, and you can then drag and drop them into
one of the lower sections that correspond to a specific release. Using
the scroll arrows you can cycle through the releases and move any items
from one release to another.</p>
<p>The header of each release section shows the overall progress and
utilization of the release:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_420.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on the Release hyperlink will switch the planning board into
the <a href="#release-backlog-planning">Release Backlog</a> view described below.</p>
<h3 id="release-planning-by-priority">Release Planning -- By Priority</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the list of planned backlog items,
organized by requirement importance. Each of the possible importance
values is displayed on the left-hand side and the backlog items
displayed in the same row on the right. The backlog items in this view
will only be requirements (with associated tasks and test cases).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_421.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of items that are not assigned a
priority, with the other sections containing the items that have been
assigned to the specific priority.</p>
<h3 id="release-planning-by-status">Release Planning -- By Status</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product planned items organized
by requirement status. Each of the possible status values (for a planned
item) is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items displayed in the
same column underneath. The backlog items in this view will only be
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases). This view is
commonly called a <strong>Kanban</strong> board:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_422.png" /></p>
<p>Each of the vertical sections is one of the requirements' statuses, in
order of the requirement lifecycle (Planned > Completed). You can click
on the expand/collapse icons to hide any statuses that are not used. You
can drag and drop the requirements between the different statuses. If
you have the planning options enabled to have requirements status'
automatically update based on changes to the associated tasks and test
cases, then items will automatically move between the statuses based on
tasks being completed and test cases being executed.</p>
<h3 id="release-planning-by-person">Release Planning -- By Person</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the product planned items organized
by resource / person. Each of the users that is a member of the current
release is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items displayed in
the same column underneath. The backlog items in this view can be either
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases) or incidents.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_423.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on the expand/collapse icons to hide any resources that
are not relevant. Above the resource headings there is a section with
the release name; that contains backlog items that are scheduled for the
current release but have not yet been assigned to a resource. You can
drag and drop the backlog items between resources or to/from the release
backlog. Any backlog items not assigned to a resource and release will
be listed in the (Unassigned Items) section at the top.</p>
<h2 id="release-backlog-planning">Release Backlog Planning</h2>
<p>The release backlog view is designed to let you view the backlog items
that have been assigned to the selected release. You can always see the
items not currently assigned to any release by expanding the 'Unassigned
Items' section and then drag those items into the current release.</p>
<p>The lower section of the board allows you to segment the items by either
iteration/sprint (typically used in <strong>Scrum</strong>), by status (typically
used in <strong>Kanban</strong>), or by person.</p>
<h3 id="release-backlog-by-sprint">Release Backlog -- By Sprint</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the release backlog organized by
iteration / sprint. Each of the sprints defined for the current release
is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items displayed in the same
column underneath. The backlog items in this view can be either
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases) or incidents. This
view is commonly called a <strong>Scrum</strong> board:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_424.png" /></p>
<p>You can drag and drop the requirements between the different sprints. If
you schedule a requirement for a specific sprint, all the child tasks
that have not yet been started, will follow the parent requirement in
being associated with the sprint. Once the backlog item has been added
to the sprint, the utilized effort for the sprint will increase, and the
available effort will decrease by the same amount.</p>
<p>Note: The system will allow you to assign more backlog items to an
sprint than it is possible to complete, however this will result in a
negative value for 'available effort'. If this happens, the "Available
Effort" value will be displayed in red, and you need to rebalance the
items, extend the sprint length or add product personnel resources to
the sprint.</p>
<p>Clicking on the Sprint hyperlinks in the headers will switch the
planning board into the <a href="#sprint-backlog-planning">Sprint Backlog</a> view described below.</p>
<h3 id="release-backlog-by-status">Release Backlog -- By Status</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the release backlog organized by
requirement status. Each of the possible status values (for a planned
item) is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items displayed in the
same column underneath. The backlog items in this view will only be
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases). This view is
commonly called a <strong>Kanban</strong> board:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_425.png" /></p>
<p>Each of the vertical sections is one of the requirements' statuses, in
order of the requirement lifecycle (Planned > Completed). You can click
on the expand/collapse icons to hide any statuses that are not used. You
can drag and drop the requirements between the different statuses. If
you have the planning options enabled to have requirements status'
automatically update based on changes to the associated tasks and test
cases, then items will automatically move between the statuses based on
tasks being completed and test cases being executed.</p>
<h3 id="release-backlog-by-person">Release Backlog -- By Person</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the release backlog organized by
resource / person. Each of the users that is a member of the current
release is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items displayed in
the same column underneath. The backlog items in this view can be either
requirements (with associated tasks and test cases) or incidents.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_426.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on the expand/collapse icons to hide any resources that
are not relevant. The system will display a progress bar for each
resource to illustrate the allocation for that resource. Any resource
that has a progress bar that is completely green has been fully
scheduled and should not have any additional items assigned. If the
progress bar for that resource turns red, it means that they have been
over-scheduled and you need to reassign some of the items.</p>
<p>Above the resource headings there is a section with the release name;
that contains backlog items that are scheduled for the current release
but have not yet been assigned to a resource. You can drag and drop the
backlog items between resources or to/from the release backlog. Any
backlog items not assigned to a resource and release will be listed in
the (Unassigned Items) section at the top.</p>
<h3 id="release-backlog-by-priority">Release Backlog -- By Priority</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the list of planned backlog items
in the current release, organized by requirement importance. Each of the
possible importance values is displayed on the left-hand side and the
backlog items displayed in the same row on the right. The backlog items
in this view will only be requirements (with associated tasks and test
cases).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_427.png" /></p>
<p>The top section will contain the list of items that are not assigned a
priority, with the other sections containing the items that have been
assigned to the specific priority.</p>
<h2 id="sprint-backlog-planning">Sprint Backlog Planning</h2>
<p>The sprint backlog view is designed to let you view the backlog items
that have been assigned to the selected iteration / sprint. You can
always see the items not currently assigned to any release or sprint by
expanding the 'Unassigned Items' section and then drag those items into
the current release or sprint.</p>
<p>The lower section of the board allows you to segment the items by either
status (typically used in <strong>Kanban</strong>), or by person. You can also view
the Task artifacts by person or status for the current sprint.</p>
<h3 id="sprint-backlog-by-status">Sprint Backlog -- By Status</h3>
<p>This view is designed to let you see the iteration / sprint plan
organized by requirement status. Each of the possible status values (for
a planned item) is displayed as a heading, with the backlog items
displayed in the same column underneath. The backlog items in this view
will only be requirements (with associated tasks and test cases).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_428.png" /></p>
<p>Each of the vertical sections is one of the requirements' statuses, in
order of the requirement lifecycle (Planned > Completed). You can drag
and drop the requirements between the different statuses. If you have
the planning options enabled to have requirements status' automatically
update based on changes to the associated tasks and test cases, then
items will automatically move between the statuses based on tasks being
completed and test cases being executed.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../img/Planning_Board_429.png" /></p>
<p>You can click on the expand/collapse icons to hide any resources that
are not relevant. The system will display a progress bar for each

<p>Above the resource headings there are sections with the release and
sprint name; they contain backlog items that are scheduled for the
current release or sprint but have not yet been assigned to a resource.
You can drag and drop the backlog items between resources or to/from the
release/sprint backlog. Any backlog items not assigned to a resource and
release/sprint will be listed in the (Unassigned Items) section at the
