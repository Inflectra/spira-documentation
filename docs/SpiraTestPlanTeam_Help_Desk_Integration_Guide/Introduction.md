#  Introduction

SpiraTeam® is an integrated **Application Lifecycle Management** (ALM)
system that manages your project\'s requirements, releases, test cases,
issues and tasks in one unified environment:

SpiraTeam^®^ contains all of the features provided by SpiraTest^®^ - our
highly acclaimed **test management system** and SpiraPlan^®^ - our
**agile project management** solution. With integrated customizable
dashboards of key project information, SpiraTeam® allows you to take
control of your entire project lifecycle and synchronize the hitherto
separate worlds of development, issues tracking, and testing.

Many organizations use helpdesk applications to interact with clients
and customers. These tools can also provide powerful feedback about
issues in your products. Therefore SpiraPlan, SpiraTest and SpiraTeam
are capable of integrating with a number of help desk systems, including
**KronoDesk**^®^ (Inflectra's fully featured helpdesk tool).

This guide outlines how to integrate and use SpiraTest, SpiraPlan and
SpiraTeam in conjunction with third party helpdesk applications, to more
closely integrate product development and testing with user feedback.

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with both SpiraTeam and
the appropriate tool being discussed. For information regarding how to
use SpiraTeam, please refer to the *SpiraTeam User Manual*.

Each of the sections covers a different tool so we recommend using the
table of contents on the left to locate the tool you're looking to
either integrate or migrate from, then read the installation and usage
instructions.
