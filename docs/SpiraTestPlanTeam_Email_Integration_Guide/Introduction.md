# Introduction

SpiraTeam® is an integrated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
system that manages your project\'s requirements, releases, test cases,
issues and tasks in one unified environment:

SpiraTeam® contains all of the features provided by SpiraTest^®^ - our
highly acclaimed quality assurance system and SpiraPlan® - our
agile-enabled project management solution. With integrated customizable
dashboards of key project information, SpiraTeam® allows you to take
control of your entire project lifecycle and synchronize the hitherto
separate worlds of development and testing.

This guide describes how to setup the integration between SpiraTeam and
your company's email system so that inbound emails can be processed by
SpiraTeam and automatically converted into either new incidents or as
comments on existing artifacts.
