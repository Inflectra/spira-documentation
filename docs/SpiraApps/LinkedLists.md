# Linked Lists
This SpiraApp helps you link artifact list fields so that if a specific field is set to a certain value, then another list field will have its dropdown options limited. For example, an Incident of Type 'Enhancement' could have it's owner field limited to the user who is the Product Owner, because they review all logged enhancements so they can be added to the product backlog. The SpiraApp is highly customizable using the product settings, so the behavior can be applied to each product separately.
