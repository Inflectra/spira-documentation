#  Importing from Microsoft Excel (Office365)

If you are using Office365 in the cloud (via a web browser) or if you
are using Microsoft Office 2016+, you can use the dedicated Office365
Microsoft Excel add-in.

## Installation

To install the add-in, go to the **insert** tab in Excel. Click on
**"Office Add-Ins"** and in the window that opens navigate to the
**store** tab. Enter **"SpiraTeam Excel 365 Integration"** into the
search bar and search. When you see the correct add-in developed by
Inflectra, click on the "Add" button associated with it. You should now
see the SpiraTeam icon labeled "Show add-in" in your home tab. Click on
it to begin.

## The Template

Downloading and Applying:

When you first open the add-in, you should
see the following in your welcome screen:

Click on the **"Download Template"** button to begin the download. If
you are using a desktop version of Excel open the file as you would any
other workbook.



If you are using Excel Online, you will
need to upload the file to your **OneDrive**. You can get to OneDrive
quickly by clicking on the menu icon in the top left corner of Excel
Online and selecting OneDrive.
You should now see the following in your Excel Window:

**
At this point please click on "File" and "Save As". Create a new copy of
the template and name it after the project you plan on working on.
Remember to do this before making any changes to the template or logging
in to avoid overwriting your original template.**

For a full description list of the template fields, please refer to the
table in [Excel](../Importing%20from%20Microsoft%20Excel/#importing-exporting-data). The only differences are the (temporary)
exclusion of the linked requirements and comments fields, as well as the
30 "CUS-01" style custom fields. This add-in will load your custom field
names dynamically. To do this, you must now log in.

## Connecting to SpiraTeam

Once the template is loaded, click on the
SpiraExcel add-in ribbon icon to show the exporter and fill in the
following fields:

-   **Your Team's Spira Url:** The web address that you use to access
SpiraTeamÂ® in your browser. This is usually in the form
***https://<hostname\>/SpiraTeam.com***. Make sure to remove any
suffixes from the address (e.g. /Default/aspx). The url **must** be
an https address, if your url does not begin with https:// it will
not work.

-   **Your Username:** The username that you use for logging in to
SpiraTeam

-   **Your API key:** The API key associated with your SpiraTeam account




You will be notified if there is an issue with your url or the user
information you provided. If your log in is successful, you will see the
following screen where you can select a SpiraTeam project to load
information from:

Select a project and an artifact to populate the fields in the template
that have drop down lists associated with them (e.g. users, releases,
components, etc.) and populate the list of custom fields associated with
the project. You are now ready to begin creating requirements.

## Creating Requirements

After you have selected your project and an artifact (currently only
requirements are available) You may start filling out your worksheet.
The ID \# field should be left empty for new requirements. If the field
is not empty the row will be ignored. This is to avoid affecting any
existing requirements.

**Custom Fields:** If you have selected your project and artifact type,
you should see the custom fields associated with your project in the
custom fields section of the template (it will be empty if your project
has no custom fields for requirements). You **must** know what data the
custom field will accept. For a list of acceptable data types for
different fields, refer to the template field chart in [Excel](../Importing%20from%20Microsoft%20Excel/#importing-exporting-data).

**Indenting and Hierarchy:** Indents are
handled with a "\>" symbol. The farther in a requirement needs to be
indented, the more "\>" symbols are required. The first requirement will
**always** be at the root level. For an example of this, refer to the
values in the template:

If you were to send these new requirements to your existing project,
they would show up in SpiraTeam like this:

**Event Log:** When requirements are
sending, you will see a loading spinner and a log of progress that looks
like this:

Here is a list of possible messages:

***(Requirement name)* sent successfully:** The requirement in line was
successfully created in SpiraTeam

***(Requirement name)* failed to send:** The requirement could not be
created in SpiraTeam. May be missing a required field. Check console for
response from API.

***(Requirement ID)* was not updated:** The requirement had a value in
its ID field and was ignored. If it was intended to be a new
requirement, please clear the ID field and try again.

**Done!:** All requirements in queue have either been created, rejected,
or ignored.

When requirements are sent successfully their ID field will be filled
out with the new ID created in SpiraTeam.

To clear the event log, click on **Clear Log.**

## Saving the Worksheet and Logging Out

Make sure you had previously created a new file by selecting **Save As**
so you don't overwrite your template. Name the worksheet the same as
your project so it is easy to keep organized. Excel will then either
auto save any changes you make or you can save the worksheet the same as
any other worksheet in Excel.

When you have finished sending requirements to SpiraTeam, click on **Log
Out** to disconnect and return to the log in screen.
