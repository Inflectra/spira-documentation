# Welcome to the SpiraPlan Quick Start Guide
In this guide we will learn about the different parts of the application, how to use them, and how they fit together. You don't need to know how to use the application already, and you don't need to be familiar with application management tools, or agile, or waterfall.

All you need to get started is the application itself.

## Introduction
!!! tip "You say SpiraTest I say SpiraPlan"

    The SpiraPlan family of applications comes in 3 different editions:

    - SpiraTest
    - SpiraTeam, which is SpiraTest plus some extra features
    - SpiraPlan, which takes all the features of SpiraTeam and adds a few more

    Whatever flavor of Spira you have (we will say "SpiraPlan" from here on) you can use this Quick Start Guide. 

This Quick Start Guide is split into different parts. You can dip into any part you want. However, we recommend doing the parts in order. This will really let you see the power of how things connect together to help you meet your goals. However you approach it and whatever edition of Spira you have, there will be clear signposts and tips to guide you along the way.
