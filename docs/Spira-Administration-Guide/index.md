!!! info "How to use this guide"
    **This documentation is designed for all administrators of SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, or SpiraPlan.**

    To find the section you need, open the "Admin Guide" section from the site navigation to see all available chapters.

    If you are installing Spira on your own servers, please read the "Installing Spira" chapter carefully. This is not required if you are hosted in the cloud by Inflectra.

    We recommend that all new administrators read the section "System Administration" to get an overview of the administration functions in the application.
