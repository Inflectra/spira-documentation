#  0BIntroduction

SpiraTeam® is an integrated **Application Lifecycle Management** (ALM)
system that manages your project\'s requirements, releases, test cases,
issues and tasks in one unified environment:

SpiraTeam® contains all of the features provided by SpiraTest^®^ - our
highly acclaimed **test management system** and SpiraPlan® - our **agile
project management** solution. With integrated customizable dashboards
of key project information, SpiraTeam® allows you to take control of
your entire project lifecycle and synchronize the hitherto separate
worlds of development and testing.

However many organizations may be already using other requirements
management systems and not want to have to migrate all their users over
to SpiraTeam. Therefore SpiraPlan, SpiraTest and SpiraTeam are capable
of integrating with a variety of third-party requirements management
systems.

This guide outlines how to integrate and use SpiraTest, SpiraPlan and
SpiraTeam in conjunction with other external requirements management
systems.

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with both SpiraTeam and
the appropriate tool being discussed. For information regarding how to
use SpiraTeam, please refer to the *SpiraTeam User Manual*.

Each of the sections covers a different tool so we recommend using the
table of contents on the left to locate the tool you're looking to
either integrate or migrate from, then read the installation and usage
instructions.
