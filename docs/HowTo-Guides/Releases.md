## How to create a release {: .section-break}
1. Select releases from the "Artifact" dropdown on the global navigation bar
2. This will open the releases list view
3. Click the "Insert" button from the toolbar. 
    
    - If you have no release selected then the new release is added at the bottom of the list (this will be on the last page if you have multiple pages of releases)
    - If you have one release selected, the new release is added immediately above that release, as its sibling

4. Note that the dropdown for this button has additional options, including to create a child (release or sprint) of an existing release, if one is selected
