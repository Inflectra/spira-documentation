Enter the following default details to start using the system:

-   Login: administrator

-   Password: PleaseChange

Once logged-in, you are shown your "My Page". The very first time you
log in you will be able to take a quick orientation tour of the
application (as shown in the screenshot below).

empty product:

The product home page shows various widgets containing key product
metrics. These are empty now, because the product has no data in it. In
the rest of this guide we are going to fix that.
