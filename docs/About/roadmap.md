## Future Releases
### Planning
- **New planning tools and visualizations**: Enhanced planning board, including being able to apply filters, additional ways to group data, and swim lanes.
- **Enhanced program level management (SpiraPlan only)**: Manage risks at the program level. Increased variety of portfolio and enterprise widgets. Program level planning, releases, and roadmapping.

### Testing
- **New testing tools**: Dynamic/smart test sets whose test cases are live updated based on a set of user-controlled criteria.
- **Enhanced Test Set Management**: Add the ability to run a test set in series, with parts being handed off to multiple people in sequence 

### Developing
- **Enhanced source code management**: the ability to tie a branch to a sprint or release. Code review tools built into the application.

### Tracking
- **Time tracking**: Enhancements to existing timecard and time logging features. Add the ability for a named user or role to approve a timecard.
- **Group users by teams and tracks**: Create different teams and tracks at the system level and assign users to each. These can then be used to plan, assign, and track work.
- **Resource tracking**: New resource planning tools to let you plan activity based on required skills, time, and other metrics. Tagging users or team (e.g. with skills) can help with this.

### Reporting
- **Reporting across workspaces**: Add reports that can be run at the program, portfolio, and enterprise level.
- **Improved reporting templating**: The ability to create a specific using a preset document template, so that the report format can more closely resemble your company style.

### Cross-cutting
- **New field types and handling**: Ability to set date-time values on list pages. Add new custom property types (for example, dependent dropdowns, releases, hierarchical dropdowns, passwords). Increase the number of available custom properties per artifact.
- **New custom fields in different workspace types**: Add optional custom properties that can be set on a workspace itself - for example, on a product or progrgam.
- **Cross application tagging**: Tag support to provide a flexible way to connect different artifacts together, including resources. Add the ability to use mentions (eg @amycribbins) to reference a user or artifact in descriptions and comments.
- **More control and visibility of notifications**: Notifications can be triggered by changes to releases, and by changes to an artifact’s custom properties. Notifications can be flagged to a user and viewed by them from inside the application.
- **Improved ‘first-time’ experience**: When the main administrator first logs in, a new welcome screen will guide them in setting up the application or to get help doing so.
- **Review Center**: A single, central place to view all the areas across the application where your review is needed. This will streamline and simplify how know what they need to review and sign off and how that review is carried out.

### Wider ecosystem
- **Simplified integration with third party tools**: clearer integration guidance in-app to make syncing with tools like JIRA and ADO quicker and easier.
- **Improved extensibility**: Support for webhooks, increased API scope, potentially the ability for users to provide in-app UI changes to meet specific types of use case.
