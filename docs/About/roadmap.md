# Development Roadmap

!!! info "About"
    This roadmap outlines the functionality planned for future releases of the Spira platform (including SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, and SpiraPlan). Where not specified, a feature will be available in all Spira editions.
    
    It is not set in stone. We are always listening to feedback from our customers and new ideas that will have the most impact to users.

    It does not reflect all the work and changes we have planned. The roadmap focuses on large scale features. It does not include small scale features, enhancements, or bug fixes. [We do not provide a public list of open bugs](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB698.aspx) or enhancement requests at this time.
    
    If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding this roadmap, please email us at [support@inflectra.com](mailto:support@inflectra.com).

## Longer term thematic ideas
The list below are features that we are focused on delivering but not in the above timeline. We look for ways to deliver each (all or in part) with smaller enhancements in the short-term, or to integrate them into our timeline based on user feedback.

- **Portfolio level planning** with "Strategic Outcomes" and "Portfolio Milestones" <span class="pill">SpiraPlan</span>
- **New testing tools**: Dynamic/smart test sets whose test cases are live updated based on a set of user-controlled criteria.
- **Enhanced source code management**: the ability to tie a branch to a sprint or release. Code review tools built into the application.
- **Resource tracking**: New resource planning tools to let you plan activity based on required skills, time, and other metrics. Tagging users or teams (e.g. with skills) can help with this.
- **Improved report templating**: The ability to create a specific report using a preset document template, so that the report format can more closely resemble your company style.
- **More control and visibility of notifications**: Notifications can be triggered by changes to releases, and by changes to an artifact’s custom properties. Notifications can be flagged to a user and viewed by them from inside the application.
- **Enhanced Support for BDD**: Improve handling of BDD scenarios, and add the ability to convert BDD scenarios into executable automation scripts.
