## Version 6.6 (Summer 2020)
NOTE: The following features may be split across various point releases to 6.5 and/or 6.6

- **Baselining a product to a specific point in time (SpiraTeam and SpiraPlan)**: Enhancements to history tracking will mean users can create read-only baselines of a product at a specific time. With baselining, you can see exactly what your data looked like when a specific sprint or release was completed.
- **Improved methodologies for effort and progress rollups**: How task progress and efforts are calculated at the requirement and release level and how they rollup to parent requirements and releases will be rationalized and streamlined to make them more intuitive.
- **Industry and methodology specific template and samples**: Specific templates for different ways of working will allow users to spend even less time setting up their products. Pick the methodology that best fits your needs and use it out the box. This will include reworked agile and waterfall templates, and templates for life sciences and more.

## Planning
- **Enhanced program level management (SpiraPlan only)**: Manage risks at the program level. Program level planning and roadmapping.
- **New planning tools and visualizations**: Enhanced planning board, including being able to view by status and component.
- **Review Center**: A single, central place to view all the areas across the application where your review is needed. This will streamline and simplify how know what they need to review and sign off and how that review is carried out.

## Tracking
- **Group users by teams and tracks**: Create different teams and tracks at the system level and assign users to each. These can then be used to plan, assign, and track work.
- **Resource and time tracking**: Enhancements to existing timecard and time logging features. New resource planning tools will let you plan activity based on required skills, time, and other metrics. Tagging users or team (e.g. with skills) can help with this.
- **Financial management and earned value management module**: 
## Testing and Development
- **New testing tools**: Risk-based testing analysis and recommendations. Dynamic/smart test sets whose test cases are live updated based on a set of user-controlled criteria.
- **Enhanced source code management**: Improved branch functionality, including the ability to tie a branch to a sprint or release. Code review tools built into the application.

## Notifications and Messaging
- **Improved instant messenger**: Better handling of multiple simultaneous chat sessions, including make it easier to start new chats with online users. “Is Typing” indicator to know when a colleague is actively chatting with you. Users can indicate if they are free/busy, and can choose whether to receive IM’s via email. Group chat functionality.
- **More control and visibility of notifications**: Notifications can be triggered by changes to releases, and by changes to an artifact’s custom properties. Notifications can be flagged to a user and viewed by them from inside the application.

## Quality of Life
- **Improved ‘first-time’ experience**: When the main administrator first logs in, a new welcome screen will guide them in setting up the application or to get help doing so.
- **Improved reporting templating**: The ability to create a specific using a preset document template, so that the report format can more closely resemble your company style.
- **Simplified integration with third party tools**: New in-app wizards to make integration with or migrating from tools like JIRA and TFS quicker, and easier.
- **New field types and handling**: Ability to set date-time values on list pages. Add hierarchical dropdown custom property type.
- **Collect free form ideas**: Users can jot down simple free form notes or ideas. Plain text notes can be created in a product as well, which can be edited on and updated from within the application. Potentially these notes could be transposed into, for example, a list of requirements, to make bulk data entry within the application simpler.
