# Development Roadmap

!!! info "About"
    This roadmap outlines the functionality planned for future releases of the Spira platform (including SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, and SpiraPlan). Where not specified, a feature will be available in all Spira editions.
    
    It is not set in stone. We are always listening to feedback from our customers and new ideas that will have the most impact to users.

    It does not reflect all the work and changes we have planned. The roadmap focuses on large scale features. It does not include small scale features, enhancements, or bug fixes. [We do not provide a public list of open bugs](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB698.aspx) or enhancement requests at this time.
    
    If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding this roadmap, please email us at [support@inflectra.com](mailto:support@inflectra.com).

## What has been released
Please take a look at our [release notes](release-notes-v8.md) to see a complete list of the changes (large and small) that we have recently delivered.

## Q2 2025
- Ability to use Inflectra.ai features for requirements on the requirement list page to more easily automate action against multiple requirements at once
- Ability to export test sets and their test cases to another product
- More power, flexibility, and ease of use in our Jira cloud data sync

## Rest of 2025
- **Inflectra.ai**

    - Artifact description analysis. This will give feedback, recommendations, and rewrites, to ensure descriptions adhere to writing standards (like "plain English", EARS, and more).
    - Summarization of an artifact or its comments.
    - Automatic sprint notes. Append analysis of the sprint contents to its description in an easily understandable way.

- Allow admins to customize requirement statuses to help them create more flexible workloads.
- Improve the program level planning boards. <span class="pill">SpiraPlan</span>

## Longer term thematic ideas
The list below are features that we are focused on delivering but not in the above timeline. We look for ways to deliver each (all or in part) with smaller enhancements in the short-term, or to integrate them into our timeline based on user feedback.

- **Inflectra.ai**

    - Natural language custom report creation
    - Improved artifact creation tools, by using more context about the original artifact and its relationships to other artifacts
    - Allow users to specify example artifacts to use to customize artifact creation to align with their specific needs
    - Targeted risk analysis of artifacts in different dimensions (such as governance, security, and compliance)
    - Application-wide help chatbot
    - Deeper contextual searching and analysis of artifact data and associations to provide new insights and faster workflows

- **Enhance traceability** with a new requirement view with integrated test case analysis and potentially other artifacts.
- Evolve **program level functionality** with comment and attachment functionality, and enhanced associations to product level artifacts. <span class="pill">SpiraPlan</span>
- Further enhance **administrative audit tracking** with system and template level change tracking.
- New **product team features** so that members can receive notifications and let users assign a team to artifacts. <span class="pill">SpiraPlan</span>
- **Portfolio level planning** with "Strategic Outcomes" and "Portfolio Milestones" <span class="pill">SpiraPlan</span>
- **New testing tools**: Dynamic/smart test sets whose test cases are live updated based on a set of user-controlled criteria.
- **Enhanced source code management**: improve integration with Git cloud providers, the ability to tie a branch to a sprint or release.
- **Resource tracking**: New resource planning tools to let you plan activity based on required skills, time, and other metrics. Tagging users or teams (e.g. with skills) can help with this.
- **Improved report templating**: The ability to create a specific report using a preset document template, so that the report format can more closely resemble your company style.
- **More control and visibility of notifications**: Notifications can be triggered by changes to releases, and by changes to an artifactâ€™s custom properties. Notifications can be flagged to a user and viewed by them from inside the application.
- **Enhanced Support for BDD**: Improve handling of BDD scenarios, and add the ability to convert BDD scenarios into executable automation scripts.
