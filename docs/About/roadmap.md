# Development Roadmap

!!! info "About"
    This roadmap outlines the functionality planned for future releases of the Spira platform (including SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, and SpiraPlan). Where not specified, a feature will be available in all Spira editions.
    
    It is not set in stone. We are always listening to feedback from our customers and new ideas that will have the most impact to users.

    It is not reflect all the work and changes we have planned. The roadmap focuses on large scale features. It does not include small scale features, enhancements, or bug fixes. [We do not provide a public list of open bugs](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB698.aspx) or enhancement requests at this time.
    
    If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding this roadmap, please email us at [support@inflectra.com](mailto:support@inflectra.com).

**Further planning board improvements, including at the program level**


## Longer term thematic ideas
The list below are features that we are focused on delivering but not in the above timeline. We look for ways to deliver each (all or in part) with smaller enhancements in the short-term, or to integrate them into our timeline based on user feedback.

- **New testing tools**: Dynamic/smart test sets whose test cases are live updated based on a set of user-controlled criteria.
- **Enhanced Test Set Management**: Add the ability to run a test set in series, with parts being handed off to multiple people in sequence 
- **Enhanced source code management**: the ability to tie a branch to a sprint or release. Code review tools built into the application.
- **Time tracking**: Enhancements to existing timecard and time logging features. Add the ability for a named user or role to approve a timecard.
- **Resource tracking**: New resource planning tools to let you plan activity based on required skills, time, and other metrics. Tagging users or team (e.g. with skills) can help with this.
- **Improved reporting templating**: The ability to create a specific using a preset document template, so that the report format can more closely resemble your company style.
- **New field types and handling**: Ability to set date-time values on list pages. Even more custom property types (for example, dependent dropdowns and hierarchical dropdowns).
- **More control and visibility of notifications**: Notifications can be triggered by changes to releases, and by changes to an artifact’s custom properties. Notifications can be flagged to a user and viewed by them from inside the application.
- **Improved ‘first-time’ experience**: When the main administrator first logs in, a new welcome screen will guide them in setting up the application or to get help doing so.
