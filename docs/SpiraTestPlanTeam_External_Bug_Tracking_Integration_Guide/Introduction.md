#  Introduction

SpiraTest^®^ provides an integrated, holistic Quality Assurance (QA)
management solution that manages requirements, tests and incidents in
one environment, with complete traceability from inception to
completion.

SpiraTeam^®^ is an integrated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
system that manages your project\'s requirements, releases, test cases,
issues and tasks in one unified environment. SpiraTeam^®^ contains all
of the features provided by SpiraTest^®^ - our highly acclaimed quality
assurance system and SpiraPlan^®^ - our agile-enabled project management
solution.

However, many organizations may be already using other bug-tracking
systems and not want to have to migrate all their users over to
SpiraTeam. Therefore SpiraPlan, SpiraTest and SpiraTeam are capable of
integrating with a variety of commercial and open-source bug-tracking
systems.

This guide outlines how to integrate and use SpiraTest, SpiraPlan and
SpiraTeam in conjunction with other external Bug/Issue Tracking systems.

This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with both SpiraTeam and
the appropriate tool being discussed. For information regarding how to
use SpiraTeam, please refer to the *SpiraTeam User Manual*.

Each of the sections covers a different tool so we recommend using the
table of contents on the left to locate the tool you're looking to
either integrate or migrate from, then read the installation and usage
instructions.
