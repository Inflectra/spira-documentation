# Spira Platform Documentation
Here you will find the documentation for the entire Spira suite of products. This is still a work in progress, so please report any inconsistencies or issues to [support@inflectra.com](mailto:support@inflectra.com)
# Introduction

The Spira™ family of applications from Inflectra® are a powerful set of
tools that help you manage your software lifecycle.

SpiraTest® is our powerful and easy to use requirements, test and defect
management system, ideal for quality assurance teams.

SpiraTeam® is our integrated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
system that manages your product's requirements, releases, test cases,
issues and tasks in one unified environment.

SpiraPlan® expands on the features in SpiraTeam® to provide a complete
Enterprise Agile Planning® solution that lets you manage risks,
products, programs and the entire organization with ease.

This user manual outlines the features and functionality available in
all three Spira™ products, and demonstrates how to use the system on a
typical product.

## Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance is a key component of the Software Development
Life-Cycle (SDLC), which needs to be integrated into the planning and
management of a program or product from its inception. Too often though,
QA is implemented as *Quality Control* - whereby testing that the
required functionality works as expected, is performed at the end, when
it is most costly to make corrections and changes.

To manage QA across a product from day one, it is imperative that the
original requirements are documented together with the use-cases that
validate the desired functionality. These use-cases then form the basis
of the test scripts that can be executed to validate that the
functionality has been correctly built, and that the requirements have
been satisfied. During the execution of these test scripts, failures may
occur, which are recorded as *incidents* - either to be fixed or
documented depending on the severity.

Typically, these activities require people to use at least three
different types of software:

- Requirements Management
- Test Script Management
- Defect / Issue / Bug Tracking

However, this stove-piped approach has many limitations and drawbacks,
most importantly the fact that there is no *traceability* between the
different artifacts. How can the product manager know that all the
requirements have been tested? Conversely, how can the developer know
which test script was responsible for a recorded bug -- needed to
accurately reproduce the issue?

## Product Management

As described in the Agile Manifesto, traditional waterfall software
methodologies and lifecycles have failed to delivery products on-time
and on-budget. In addition, many systems built this way will fail to
provide the expected business value as there is no ability to quickly
refine the requirements as the product progresses.

Consequently, software development has been transformed with these new
ideas and concepts, with new agile methodologies such as Scrum, and
Kanban becoming common. However, the traditional tools of product
management - requirements specifications, high level product plans,
GANTT charts, white-board schedules and top-down task management - are
too cumbersome and not well suited.
