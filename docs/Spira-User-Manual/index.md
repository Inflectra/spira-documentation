# Welcome to the SpiraPlan User Manual

!!! info "How to use this manual"
    **This documentation is designed for all users of SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, or SpiraPlan - collectively referred to as "Spira" (sounds like spiral).**

    It can be read 'cover to cover' or you can dip into a specific section for key information.   

    To find the section you need, open the "User Manual" section from the site navigation to see all available chapters.

    This manual is built around a few core areas:
    
    - An [overview of the functionality(./Functionality-Overview.md)
    - Your [user profile and home page(./User-Product-Management.md)
    - Features [common to many parts of the application(./Application-Wide.md)
    - Information about accessing the core data in Spira - which we store in areas called "Workspaces" Workspaces are hierarchical. Most data is stored in [products(./Product-Homepage.md). Products are grouped together in [programs(./Program-Homepage.md). Programs are grouped together in [portfolios(./Portfolio-Homepage.md). Portfolios are all grouped under the [enterprise(./Enterprise-Homepage.md) view.

    The Product section is by far the biggest part of this manual. This section is further divided up into 5 areas: planning, testing, developing, tracking, reporting. These areas mirror how you navigate around a product inside Spira itself.
