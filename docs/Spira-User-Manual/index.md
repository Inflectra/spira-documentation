# Welcome to the SpiraPlan User Manual

!!! info "How to use this manual"
    **This documentation is designed for all users of SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, or SpiraPlan.**

    It can be read 'cover to cover' or you can dip into a specific section for key information.   

    To find the section you need, open the "User Manual" section from the site navigation to see all available chapters.

    This manual is built around a few core areas:
    
    - An [overview of the functionality](../Functionality-Overview)
    - Your [user profile and home page](../User-Product-Management)
    - Features [common to many parts of the application](../Application-Wide)
    - Information about accessing the core data in SpiraPlan - which we store in areas called "Workspaces" Workspaces are hierarchical. Most data is stored in [products](../Product-Homepage). Products are grouped together in [programs](../Program-Homepage). Programs are grouped together in [portfolios](../Portfolio-Homepage). Portfolios are all grouped under the [enterprise](../Enterprise-Homepage) view.

    The Product section is by far the biggest part of this manual. This section is further divided up into 5 areas: planning, testing, developing, tracking, reporting. These areas mirror how you navigate around a product inside SpiraPlan itself.
