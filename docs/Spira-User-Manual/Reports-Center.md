# Reports Center

This section describes the reporting features of SpiraPlanÂ®, including an overview of each of the report types that are available. When you click on the "Reports" tab on the global navigation bar, you will initially be taken to the reports home page illustrated below:

![](img/Reports_Center_335.png)

## Overview
This page consists of four main areas:

1. The top bar shows the product name, controls for changing the graph widgets, and a **dropdown release picker**. The selected release will affect all of the reporting / graphing widgets simultaneously. You can either choose a specific release (includes any child sprints) or "All Releases". Your selection here is synced with the selection you set on the product dashboard page.
2. The top left-hand pane displays a list of any reports that have either been saved by the currently logged in user, or those reports created by other members of the product, that have been marked (by that user) as 'shareable'.
3. The bottom left-hand main pane displays a list of the printable reports available in the system, categorized by the artifact they primarily relate to (requirements, test cases, incidents and releases). Clicking on any of the report hyperlinks will take you to the [configuration page](#reports-configuration) for the report in question below for details).
4. The right-hand pane is a dashboard that contains the set of graph widgets configured by the current user. By default the dashboard will display: the Incident Progress Rate, Test Run Progress Rate, Requirement Summary, Test Case Summary, Incident Aging and Task Burndown. When "All Releases" is seleted from the dropdown release picker, some widgets show information for every single release and sprint, and others only for active releases/sprints[^active-release]:

    - Requirement Graphs widget: only active releases
    - Task Graphs widgets: only active releases
    - All Summary Graphs widgets: all releases
    - All Date-Range Graphs widgets: all releases
    - Custom Graphs that use the token ${ReleaseId}: no data
    - Custom Graphs that use the token ${ReleaseAndChildIds}: only active releases


In addition to the graphs displayed by default, you can click on the "***Add Items***" buttons to add additional graphs to the reporting dashboard:

![](img/Reports_Center_336.png)

Each of the graphs is described in more detail in [Summary Graphs](#summary-graphs) to [Date-Range Graphs](#date-range-graphs).


## Reports Configuration

The configuration page for each report differs slightly, but the general format is illustrated below (please note all sections are shown in orange text with a line beneath and are shown here in the collapsed state -- click the orange text to expand the section):

![](img/Reports_Center_337.png)

You can configure the reports in the following ways:

**Report Format** -- This allows you to specify the display format of the report. Depending on the specific report, they can be:

- displayed as a web-page (HTML)
- downloaded as a Microsoft Word document (there are two Word versions: one for newer versions of Word and one for legacy versions of Word)
- downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (there are two Excel versions: one is better for printing, while the other is more suited to data manipulation)
- downloaded as a Microsoft Product file
- there is also a raw-XML format that allows you to export the underlying report data into any external reporting system that supports XML import.

![](img/Reports_Center_338.png)

**Report Elements** -- This allows you to determine which types of information to include in the report. This varies by report type, but includes the dependent items related to the artifact being reported on (attachments, test steps, coverage, history, etc.)

![](img/Reports_Center_339.png)

**Standard Field Filters** -- This allows you to constrain the range of data being reported on, based on the various fields associated with the artifact in question. These filters are typically selections from multi-valued-dropdown lists and date-ranges.

![](img/Reports_Center_340.png)

**Custom Property Filters** -- This allows you to constrain the range of data being reported on, based on the custom fields associated with the artifact by your product administrator. These filters can be either freetext or drop-down lists.

![](img/Reports_Center_341.png)

**Sort Options** - This option is only available for the non-hierarchical data reports (i.e. for test cases, test sets, test runs, incidents and tasks) and allows you to specify the sort order of the results returned in the report. For the hierarchical-data based reports the sort order is always the order of the hierarchy.

![](img/Reports_Center_342.png)

**Report Name** -- If you would like to save the report configuration so that you can quickly re-run it at a later date, you just need to enter a name for the report and indicate (by selecting the checkbox or not) whether you want this report to be private or shared by all members of the product.

![](img/Reports_Center_343.png)

Once you have selected the format, elements and filters, clicking the "***Create Report***" button launches the report in a new window. Each of the reports is described in [Requirement Reports](#requirement-reports) to [Release Reports](#release-reports) below:

Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


### Task Burndown Chart
The Task Burndown graph shows the effort (in hours) on the y-axis. The x-axis shows releases/sprints - the releases/sprints shown changes as you change the release selector at the top of the page. To be useful tasks in the product have to have their effort fields populated (specifically Estimated Effort and Remaining Effort).

The blue line on the graphs indicates the ideal burndown. The other line shows the estimated actual burndown. The graph also shows bars for the remaining and completed effort for each relevant release/sprint.

![](img/Reports_Center_379.png)

**How changing the displayed release for the page changes the x-axis:**

- **All Releases**: all active releases in the product
- **Specific Release**: all sprints within the chosen release. If the release has no sprints, the chart will be empty -- child releases are not shown
- **Specific Sprint**: each day of the sprint, from its start to end date. In order for the chart to be meaningful, tasks must have start and end dates that are within the sprint's dates. 

Clicking on the "***Display Data Grid***" button shows the underlying data used to generate the graph. Clicking the `Download Data as CSV` exports the data into Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. Some browsers support saving the graph as an image (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


## Date-Range Graphs

### Test Run Progress Rate Graph

The Test Run Progress Rate Graph shows how many tests have been executed for the selected release/sprint for a specific date range, and what execution status was recorded. The graph can be displayed for all test case types or for a specific type.

![](img/Reports_Center_380.png)

In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of test runs executed in each 24 hour period, and the x-axis represents a specific week in the time-span. Each data-bar can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the point, and a "tooltip" will pop-up listing the actual data value. You can filter the report by the release/sprint that the test run was executed against, and also change the date range. If you choose a smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly.

Clicking on the "***Display Data Grid***" button will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the "***Download Data as CSV***" button will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


### Test Case Progress Rate Graph

The Test Case Progress Rate Graph displays the number of test case executions for the specified date range, against the specified release/sprint, ignoring the status from any previous days. Any test cases not executed that day will be considered "not run" and will appear in the "not run" category. 

For example, if you have 10 test cases created on day 1 you will see 10 test cases "not run" on day 1. On day 2, you execute 5 test cases and fail them all, you will now see 5 test cases failed and 5 not run. On day 3, you execute 3 of the previous 5 test cases and pass them. You will now see 3 test cases passed, 0 failed and 7 not run.

### Test Case Cumulative Progress Graph

The Test Case Cumulative Progress Graph displays the number of test case executions cumulatively over the specified date range, against the specified release/sprint. That means it will display for each day, the total number of test cases executed plus the status from any previous days that have not been changed. Any test cases not executed up to that point will be considered "not run" and will appear in the "not run" category.

For example, if you have 10 test cases created on day 1 you will see 10 test cases "not run" on day 1. On day 2, you execute 5 test cases and fail them all, you will now see 5 test cases failed and 5 not run. On day 3, you execute 3 of the previous 5 test cases and pass them. You will now see 3 test cases passed, 2 failed and 5 not run.

### Incident Progress Rate Graph

The incident progress rate chart displays the total number of incidents created and closed over a particular date-range, either for all incident types or for a specific incident type:

![](img/Reports_Center_383.png)

In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of incidents (either created or closed in a 24 hour period), and the x-axis represents a specific day in the time-span. Each data-point can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the point, and a "tooltip" will pop-up listing the actual data value. You can filter the report by the type of incident, and also change the date range (e.g. displaying only the bugs for the date range). If you choose a smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly.

Clicking on the "***Display Data Grid***" button will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph. In addition, clicking on the "***Download Data as CSV***" button will export the datagrid into Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that can be opened in MS-Excel. Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


### Cumulative Incident Count Graph

The cumulative incident count chart displays the cumulative total number of incidents logged in the system for the current product over a particular date-range, either for all incident types or for a specific incident type. The report displays two data series, one illustrating the total count of all incidents, the other the total count of all *open incidents* (i.e. with status not set to fixed or closed):

In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of incidents, and the x-axis represents a specific week in the time-span. Each data-point can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the point, and a "tooltip" will pop-up listing the actual data value. You can also filter the type of incident being reported, as well as change the date interval. If you choose a smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly.

Clicking on the "***Display Data Grid***" button will display the underlying data that is being used to generate the graph.

Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


### Open Incident Count Graph

The open incident count chart displays the net number of open incidents in the system for the current product over a particular date-range categorized by incident priority, either for all incident types or for a specific incident type. For this chart, "open" is defined as any incident with an empty "Closed On" date. The incident status is not used for this chart.

In this version of the report, the y-axis represents the number of incidents, and the x-axis represents a specific week in the time-span. The exact count of each bar in the stacked histogram can be viewed by positioning the mouse pointer over the bar, and a "tooltip" will pop-up listing the actual data value. You can also filter the type of incident being reported, as well as change the date interval. If you choose a smaller date-range, the x-axis will switch from weekly to daily and if you choose a larger date-range, the x-axis will switch to monthly.

Some browsers also support the ability to save the graph as an image file (JPEG, PNG and GIF formats).


### Incident Count by Status Graph

The incident status count chart displays the number of open incidents in the system for the current product over a particular date-range categorized by incident status, either for all incident types or for a specific incident type. For this chart, "open" is defined as any incident with an empty "Closed On" date. The incident status is not used for this chart.

## Custom Graphs

These are the graphs that a SpiraPlan administrator has created in the Administration section of the system and published for use by end users. They rely on specific ESQL data queries, so the data represented will depend on the query created by the administrator.

To add a custom graph to your reports dashboard, click on the **Add Items** icon and choose Custom Graphs:
