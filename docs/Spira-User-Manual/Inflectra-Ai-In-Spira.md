# Inflectra.ai

## Overview
Inflectra.ai provides a variety of different functionality in Spira.

Inflectra.ai lets users create content from existing artifacts. This enhances user activity by reducing manual work to create this content, and also leverages AI to provide potentially important ideas that could otherwise be missed. These collectively help users deliver at a high level of quality more quickly. 

Please see our statement on [responsible AI usage](https://www.inflectra.com/Company/Responsible-AI-Statement.aspx). Users can only create content based on their permissions in Spira, and are not able to access any information from Inflectra.ai that they are not able to access from the application itself. Inflectra is not responsible for any content generated by the ai. 

!!! info
    Inflectra.ai is only available for cloud hosted sites. It is available in all versions of Spira (SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, and SpiraPlan).

## Details Pages
Inflectra.ai can generate content based on the current artifact being viewed from its details page. This content can either augment the artifact itself or create linked artifacts. Various key pieces of information about the artifact itself and its context are used to generate the content.

### Tagging AI generated content
Any new artifact created by Inflectra.ai will have the tag "ai-generated" added to it automatically.

Any artifact that is updated by Inflectra.ai will have the tag "ai-augmented" added to it automatically.


### Requirements
From the requirement details page you can generate the following content:

| Requirement        | Creates requirement for the functionality this test case is going to cover, especially useful within TDD (Test Driven Development) processes | 


### Tasks 
From the task details page (SpiraTeam and SpiraPlan only) you can generate the following content: 

![](img/Inflectra_ai_task_details.png)

| Generated Content                   | Description| 
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Document (code file)                | Generates a code snippet in the specified programming language, to allow the user to get a head start on development or get pointed in the right direction in terms of applicable APIs | 
| Document (unit test and code files) | From a given test framework, generates a unit test file and an associated code snippet that can be used to cover that code snippet. Programming language is determined by the testing framework provided, however you can specify that if the testing framework spans multiple languages | 

!!! tip "Generating code"
    When generating code, you are prompted to pick a programming language or a testing framework.
    
    You can give additional details to help guide Inflectra.ai to use specific tooling relevant to your codebase. For instance, if I am a web developer who works on a Java Spring Boot based application, I can enter "Java (Spring Boot)" as my programming language. The same goes for testing framework - for example: "NUnit 3 (ASP.NET Web API)".

    You can enter a value in the text input and hit enter to submit it, or quick select one of your previous entries. Previous entries are stored in the browser, so will not transfer to other browsers or computers.
