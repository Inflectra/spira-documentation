!!! abstract "Available in SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, SpiraPlan - cloud only"
    It is available to try for free in any cloud trial. 
    
    To add Inflectra.ai to your production site, you can do so from your customer area or [contact us to find out how to upgrade](mailto:sales@inflectra.com).

## Overview
Inflectra.ai provides a variety of different functionality in Spira.

Inflectra.ai lets users create content from existing artifacts. This enhances user activity by reducing manual work to create this content, and also leverages AI to provide potentially important ideas that could otherwise be missed. These collectively help users deliver at a high level of quality more quickly. 

Please see our statement on [responsible AI usage](https://www.inflectra.com/Company/Responsible-AI-Statement.aspx). Users can only create content based on their permissions in Spira, and are not able to access any information from Inflectra.ai that they are not able to access from the application itself. Inflectra is not responsible for any content generated by the ai. 

## Getting started
Trial customers can start using Inflectra.ai right away. Relevant settings are automatically turned on for trial customers.

Production customers need to proactively turn on Inflectra.ai inside Spira, before you can start using it. These actions need to be done by a system admin.

- System Admin > [General Settings](../Spira-Administration-Guide/System.md/#general-settings): set "Inflectra.ai" to yes
- System Admin > Workspaces > [View/Edit Product](../Spira-Administration-Guide/System-Workspaces.md/#edit-a-product): set "Inflectra.ai" to yes for any existing product you wish to use Inflectra.ai (note that new products will have Inflectra.ai on by default, as will sample products if the site was created at 8.10.0.0 or later)

### Where is Inflectra.ai available
You can tell if a page has Inflectra.ai functionality because you will see the Inflectra.ai icon in the navigation bar.

Inflectra.ai is available in the following places:

- **Details pages**: Inflectra.ai can generate content based on the current artifact being viewed from its details page. This content can either augment the artifact or create new artifacts.
 
    - Requirement details page
    - Test case details page
    - Task details page
    - Risk details page

- **List pages**: Inflectra.ai can generate content based on a selected list of artifacts on its list page. This content can either augment the artifact or create new artifacts.

    - Requirement list page (hierarchical)
    - Requirement list page (sortable)

### Tagging AI generated content
Any new artifact created by Inflectra.ai will have the tag "ai-generated" added to it automatically.

Any artifact that is updated by Inflectra.ai will have the tag "ai-augmented" added to it automatically.

### Chat history
Inflectra.ai stores your chat history in the browser to allow you to look back over the most recent 50 messages. Because it is being stored in the browser, this history does not transfer across browsers or computers. Previous messages are grayed out compared to the current interaction.

### Loading Indicator
When Inflectra.ai is performing a task, it will show a progress bar for the artifact currently being processed. Above the progress bar is summary information about what actions are being performed, like how many artifacts, of what type, are being created. On list pages, this summary information also shows how many artifacts are being worked on and how many are finished. 

In the following example, the task is for 10 requirements, and 5 requirements have finished. For the 6th requirement (RQ:800), half of the 10 tasks have already been created:

![](img/Inflectra_ai_requirement_list_progress.png)

### Supported Languages
The Inflectra.ai sidebar labels are localized based on the user's **[culture setting](../Spira-User-Manual/User-Product-Management.md/#regional-settings)** in these languages: English, French, German, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish. If the user's culture is not supported, English text will be shown.  
The responses from the AI are localized based on the Name and Description of the artifact being used. For example, when generating tasks for a requirement written in French, the generated tasks will also be written in French. When the input language cannot be determined or is not recognized, the response will be written in English.  

### Responsible AI Usage

#### Requirement Analysis
From the requirement details page you can analyze the requirement to see how well it is written and organized, based off specific frameworks. This provides valuable insights into the quality of the text and how effectively it may communicate its meaning to others.

The analysis includes a score from 1 to 5. A score of 5 means the requirement is very well written and does not need to be improved, while a score of 1 means lots of work is needed. Along with a score, detailed notes and guidance are provided about how to improve the requirement and why, as well as what is in good shape already.


| Analytical framework | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EARS                 | Provides an analysis of the requirement based on the EARS ruleset                                                                                                                                                   |

#### EARS Analysis
!!! info "EARS"
    The EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) framework provides a structured and constrained way to write clear, unambiguous requirements, typically following the "When [optional trigger], while [optional pre-conditions], the [system name] shall [system response]" pattern. Its value lies in reducing ambiguity and errors in requirements specifications, leading to more efficient development and testing, and ultimately, higher quality systems, because its precise structure forces clarity and helps prevent misinterpretations.

    Analytical scores are given from 1 to 5 (worst to best). This is a subjective and ultimately qualitative measure but a guide to each score is below:

    - **Score of 5**: perfectly clear, unambiguous, complete, and adheres strictly EARS patterns. It is easily testable and requires no further clarification.
    - **Score of 4**: largely clear and complete, with minor deviations from EARS. It might be missing a keyword or have a slight structural imperfection, but the intent is still very clear and it's easily understandable and testable.
    - **Score of 3**: understandable, but has noticeable issues with EARS compliance or clarity. It might be a natural language requirement that could be easily refactored into an EARS pattern, or it has some ambiguity that requires minor clarification.
    - **Score of 2**: difficult to understand, ambiguous, or incomplete. It significantly deviates from EARS principles, making it hard to interpret the true intent or to test the requirement effectively. It requires substantial rework.
    - **Score of 1**: poorly written and can not be readily interpreted. It provides little to no actionable information, is highly ambiguous, and offers no discernible path for testing. It may be contradictory.

!!! info "*Improving a description"
    If a requirement has a score of 2, 3, or 4, you can click the "Improve" button to generate a new description for the requirement. This will use the existing description, along with the already created analysis to provide a new description that is more aligned with the EARS framework. 

    The new description will overwrite the existing one, but the artifact is not saved. You must review the new description to decide whether or not to accept the changes. 
    
    Note that screenshots should be preserved in the updated description.
