# Inflectra.ai

## Overview
Inflectra.ai provides a variety of different functionality in Spira.

Inflectra.ai lets users create content from existing artifacts. This enhances user activity by reducing manual work to create this content, and also leverages AI to provide potentially important ideas that could otherwise be missed. These collectively help users deliver at a high level of quality more quickly. 

Please see our statement on [responsible AI usage](https://www.inflectra.com/Company/Responsible-AI-Statement.aspx). Users can only create content based on their permissions in Spira, and are not able to access any information from Inflectra.ai that they are not able to access from the application itself. Inflectra is not responsible for any content generated by the ai. 

!!! info
    Inflectra.ai is only available for cloud hosted sites. It is available in all versions of Spira (SpiraTest, SpiraTeam, and SpiraPlan).

    It is available to try for free in any cloud trial. To add Inflectra.ai to your production site, you can do so from your customer area or [contact us to find out how to upgrade](mailto:sales@inflectra.com).

## Getting started
Trial customers can start using Inflectra.ai right away. Relevant settings are automatically turned on for trial customers.

Production customers need to proactively turn on Inflectra.ai inside Spira, before you can start using it. These actions need to be done by a system admin.

- System Admin > [General Settings](../Spira-Administration-Guide/System.md/#general-settings): set "Inflectra.ai" to yes
- System Admin > Workspaces > [View/Edit Product](../Spira-Administration-Guide/System-Workspaces.md/#edit-a-product): set "Inflectra.ai" to yes for any existing product you wish to use Inflectra.ai (note that new products will have Inflectra.ai on by default, as will sample products if the site was created at 8.10.0.0 or later)

### Where is Inflectra.ai available

| Document (unit test and code files) | From a given test framework, generates a unit test file and an associated code snippet that can be used to cover that code snippet. Programming language is determined by the testing framework provided, however you can specify that if the testing framework spans multiple languages | 

!!! tip "Generating code"
    When generating code, you are prompted to pick a programming language or a testing framework.
    
    You can give additional details to help guide Inflectra.ai to use specific tooling relevant to your codebase. For instance, if I am a web developer who works on a Java Spring Boot based application, I can enter "Java (Spring Boot)" as my programming language. The same goes for testing framework - for example: "NUnit 3 (ASP.NET Web API)".

    You can enter a value in the text input and hit enter to submit it, or quick select one of your previous entries. Previous entries are stored in the browser, so will not transfer to other browsers or computers.
