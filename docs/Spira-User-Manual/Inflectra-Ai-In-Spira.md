# Inflectra AI

## Overview

This page describes the Inflectra AI functionality available in Spira. This feature is a separately purchased product, only available for Spira users hosted by Inflectra in the cloud. 

Inflectra AI gives users various options for creating content from existing artifacts, to cut down on the manual work needed for fleshing out the different pieces of your process required to deliver features at a high level of quality. We intend to continue to improve the prompts for existing functionality as well as add new features, to continue to expand what is possible within the Spira family of products. 

## Details Pages

This section will describe the available functionality on details pages within Inflectra AI as well as what each of them do, to help you get started with workflows including generative AI. Inflectra AI handles both generating the content of the other artifacts, creating those artifacts, and associating them to the requirement they were based on.
