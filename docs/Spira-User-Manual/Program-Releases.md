# Program Releases
The program release plan is only available in SpiraPlan. If you are using SpiraPlan, to access the program release plan, you must be a member of the program (i.e. a program owner or executive).

The program release plan lets you see all of the products in the current program, together with their releases, sprints, and phases displayed in an integrated hierarchical view:

You can access this feature by clicking on the **Releases** menu entry in the program navigation.

This view lets you see all the releases, sprints, and phases with their dates, test coverage, progress and estimated/producted estimates. You can expand and collapse the products and releases to display the appropriate level of detail as well as filter by the various fields in the grid.
